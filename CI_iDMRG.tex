%

Interactions and topological states~\cite{H88}.\\
%

%
Due to its singular importance and historical significance, 
the emergence of the Chern insulator state via interactions in the honeycomb lattice is an active
research area. 
%


%
In this work we revisit the controversies left unsolved by previous works using the infinite density matrix renormalzation group method (iDMRG). \\

\section{\label{sec:modandmeth}Model and Method}
%
In this work we focus on spinless electrons hoping on a honeycomb lattice with real nearest neighbor hopping $t$ interacting via nearest and next to nearest neighbor interactions 
$\left\lbrace V_{1},V_{2}\right\rbrace$ respectively. 
%
The Hamiltonian for this system can be written as
 %
\begin{eqnarray}
\nonumber
%
H&:=&-t\sum_{\left\langle i,j\right\rangle ,s,s'}(c^{\dagger}_{i,s}c_{j,s'}+h.c.)\\
%
\;&+&
V_{1}\sum_{\left\langle i,j\right\rangle ,s }n_{i,s}n_{j,\bar{s}}+
%
V_{2}\sum_{\left\langle \left\langle i,j\right\rangle \right\rangle ,s }n_{i,s}n_{j,s}\,
%
\label{eq:H}
%
\end{eqnarray}
%
here $c_{i,s}$ $(c^{\dagger}_{i,s})$  annihilates (creates) an electron at the $i$-th unit cell of the honeycomb lattice
in sublattice $s=A,B$ and $s\neq\bar{s}$. 
%
Each of the two triangular sublattices A and B is spanned by the basis vectors
$\bs{a}_{1}=\bs{\delta}_{2}-\bs{\delta}_{3}$ and 
$\bs{a}_{2}=\bs{\delta}_{3}-\bs{\delta}_{1}$ defined through the three nearest neighbors $\bs{\delta}_{1}=a(0,-1)$,  
$\bs{\delta}_{2}=a(\sqrt{3}/2,1/2)$ and $\bs{\delta}_{3}=a(-\sqrt{3}/2,+1/2)$ as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Defs}.\\
%

In order to find the ground state of the system in the $\left\lbrace V_{1},V_{2}\right\rbrace$ phase space
we use the infinite density matrix renormalzation group method (iDMRG). 
%

\section{Phase diagram}
%
We have used the iDMRG method presented in the previous section
to find the groundstate of the half-filled graphene lattice in the presence of 
$\left\lbrace V_{1},V_{2}\right\rbrace$ interactions.
%
Our results are summarised in the phase diagram presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}.

\begin{figure*}

 \caption{Left: Phase diagram obtained with iDMRG calculations on an infinte cylinder of circumference $L=12$. Right: Density patterns in the different phases. The area of the blue circles is proportional to the particle number expectation value on the respective site. The unit cells are depicted by the red polygons. (a) Charge modulated (CMs) phase with $V_1 = 0.8, V_2 = 3.2 $, (b) Charge density wave II (CDW II) with $V_1 = 5.6, V_2 = 3.2$,  (c) Charge density wave III (CDW III) with $V_1 = 9.2, V_2 = 2.5$, (d) Charge density wave I (CDW I) with $V_1 = 4.0, V_2 = 0.4 $. Figures (e) and (f) show the density and hopping amplitude patterns of the Kekul\'e phase. The state shows a uniform density but the hopping amplitudes break translational symmetry and form a six site unit cell. \label{fig:phase diagram}}
\end{figure*}

%
As a function of $\left\lbrace V_{1},V_{2}\right\rbrace$ we find six different phases and none of them correspond to the Haldane Chern insulator.
%
In what follows we describe their corresponding charge and bond ordering patterns and analyse the different phase transitions that occur between them.
%


%
\subsection{Semimetal phase (SM)}
%
We start by discussing the semimetal phase, labelled SM in the phase diagram shown in Fig.~\ref{}.
%
This phase is continuously connected to the gapless non-interacting state $V_{1}=V_{2}=0$; 
it is a uniform renormalization of the hopping strength $t$ by interactions.
%
Therefore we identify this state as a single particle gapless phase that lacks both charge and bond order and is described by a low energy theory in terms of two massless Dirac fermions.
%
We note that in such low energy picture and within the renormalisation group approach the stability of the semimetal phase in the region $\left\lbrace V_{1},V_{2}\right\rbrace < t$ is expected.
%
Short range interactions are irrelevant~\cite{Shankar?} and therefore they can only drive a transition to an ordered state when they have a magnitude comparable to the nearest neighbour hopping strength $t$.
%
Accordingly we find that the semimetal is stable within this region of phase space.


Within the iDMRG algorithm we have characterised the semimetal phase in three distinct ways.
%
Firstly we compute the charge and bond ground state expectation values.
%
On the one hand, at each site the charge expectation value is defined by 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:charge}
n_{i,s}=\left\langle c^{\dagger}_{i,s}c_{i,s}\right\rangle,  
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $s=A,B$ is the sublattice index.
%
To numerical accuracy we find that $n_{i,A}=n_{i,B}=1/2$, indicating that this phase is not charge ordered.
%

The bond ground state expectation value on the other hand is defined as
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:bond}
t^{s,s'}_{i,j}=\left\langle c^{\dagger}_{i,s}c_{j,s'}\right\rangle,  
\end{eqnarray}
%
For $i,j$ being nearest neighbours we find a small ($10^{-?}$ \noteAG{number needed}) asymmetry
between bonds pointing along and around the cylinder axis.
%
Such asymmetry should vanish in a perfect semimetalic phase and indeed it is severely reduced as the bond dimension $\chi$ is increased.
% 
This suggests that the explanation for the asymmetry is indeed the cylinder geometry implemented in iDMRG, that artificially differentiates bonds in its two perpendicular directions.
%

%
Moreover, we note that the semimetal phase is a critical state and thus in principle requires an infinite $\chi$ to represent the state.
%
This leads us to the second approach to characterise the semimetal phase that makes use of the its criticality.
%
For a critical phase the entanglement entropy is expected to show a logarithmic growth with the correlation length.
\noteAG{eqn needed}
%
The proportionality constant $c/3$ defines the central charge of the theory $c$. 
%
The semimetal has two Dirac cones and therefore it is expected that $c=2$. 
%
In the appendix...
\noteAG{This last paragraph can be removed if we don't need it}

%
Lastly we find that the low energy structure of the many-body 
entanglement spectrum of this phase exactly coincides with that of the parent non-interacting critical state.\\ 
%

%
We note finally that this state extends beyond 

\subsection{Charge density wave (CDW)}
%
The second state we identify is the charge density wave state, labelled CDW in the phase diagram of Fig.~\ref{}.
%
This state has a two site unit cell that is characterised by a finite order parameter
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:CDW}
%
M=\left\langle n_{A} \right\rangle-\left\langle n_{B}\right\rangle
%
\end{equation}
%
where $n_{A}$ and $n_{B}$ are the density of electrons in the $A$ and $B$ sublattice sites of the two site unit cell respectively.
%
We find that the magnitude of $M$ increases with $V_{1}$ and to numerical accuracy this phase has no appreciable bond order.\\
%

For large $V_{1}\gg t$ such a state is a natural instability since the energy is minimised by a charge imbalance between the two sub lattices.
%
Indeed, it has been found in a mean field approximation~\cite{Raghu,Franz,us}, exact diagnoalization~\cite{us,daghofer,herbut}, and quantum Monte Carlo simulations
\cite{QMC}.
%


\subsection{Sub-lattice charge modulated phase (CMs)}
%
For large $V_{2}\ll t$ the ground state is classically degenerate. 
%
Within mean field it was shown that as long $V_{2}>V_{1}$
the system chose a charge ordered pattern with charge modulation over different sub lattices and termed CMs phase~\cite{CMs}.
%
Such order, schematically shown in Fig.~\ref{}, has a six site unit cell, and minimises the large cost
attributed to $V_{2}$ by reversing two nearest neighbour dimers at the expense of paying the small energetic cost
determined by $V_{1}$.
%
Within in exact diagonalization two studies has shown that the CMs state survives quantum fluctuations 
but its nature was challenged in Ref.~\onlinecite{daghofer} suggesting that a pinball like state cannot be ruled out.\\

With the iDMRG method (see Fig.~\cite{s}) we find that directly above the semimetallic phase the CMs occurs with the right type of order.
%
The calculated charge pattern obtained from \eqref{eq:charge} is shown in Fig.~\cite{} panel, which resembles the expected
CMs pattern.
%
The six-site unit cell is depicted as a red hexagon for clarity. 
%
Such a state also presents bond ordering associated to the charge patterns.

% 
Moreover, we now show that the CMs state is expected from a semi-classical analysis as well.
%
For instance, for a given cluster, it is possible to find the number and energy of all the degenerate classical states, assuming $V_{2}\gg t$.
%
Within this approach, the hopping can be introduced as a perturbation $t$ to find how the degeneracy is lifted.
\noteAG{Maybe Fernando can rewrite this part better...} 


\subsection{Kekul\'{e} bond order}
%
The next phase we identify is the Kekul\'{e}
bond order.
%
Like the CMs, it has a six site unit cell depicted schematically in Fig.~\ref{}
and uniform charge order.
%
In mean field the state arises close to the $V_{1}\eqsim V_{2}$.
%
Although in exact diagonalization hints of this state are also observed,
the evidence supporting its occurrence is far from conclusive.



\subsection{Charge density wave - II}
%
All phases that we have described so far don't differ
from those predicted by mean field and exact diagonalization.
%
We have identified
%
\subsection{Charge density wave - III}
%



\section{Phase transitons}
%
A crucial advantage of the iDMRG method is that, unlike finite
size methods such as exact diagonalization it can characterize the order of phase transitions.
%
In order to unravel the character of the phase transitions between
the phases described above we now study two quantities that are sensitive
to a phase change, the entanglement entropy $S$ and the correlation length $\xi$.
%
In Fig.~\ref{}  and Fig.~\ref{} we show how these quantities change along
the horizontal and vertical cuts depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram} respectively.
%

\subsection{Cut A: SM--CDW-I}

The first horizontal cut, labelled A addresses the character of the phase transition between the semi-metallic
phase and the simplest charge density wave (CDW-I) by fixing $V_{2}=0$.
%
This phase transition has been previously addressed with the quantum Monte-Carlo method~\ref{papers} 
and was determined to be of second order character.
%
The transition point with divergent correlation length was determined to be at $V_{1}=$ via finite size scaling.
\noteAG{need number and polishing, Johannes?}
%
In Fig.~\ref{fig:cut_V2_0} we show the correlation length as a function of $V_{1}$ 
for different values of the bond dimension $\chi$ and cylinder with $L=12$ circumference.
\begin{figure}
 \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{{pdf/plot_cut_V2_0}.pdf}
 \label{fig:cut_V2_0}
 \caption{Correlation length at $V_2=0$.  \noteAG{could it be useful to show the order parameter M
 as a function of $V_{1}$ in the same plot (using the right vertical axis?). It might get to crowded)}}
\end{figure}
% 
%
Firstly, for $V_{1}\leq 1.5t$ we observe that the correlation length diverges as the bond
dimension of the MPS is increased.
%
This behaviour is expected for a critical state such as the semimetal phase;  
the logarithmic divergence of entanglement of a metallic state requires an MPS with $\chi\to\infty$.
%
For $V_{1}\geq 1.5t$ the correlation length drops significantly and has no longer a significant 
dependence on $\chi$.
%
This is characteristic of a gapped phase such as the charge density wave.
%
The crossover is smooth, signalling a second order phase transition, in agreement with 
quantum Monte Carlo studies.
%
With iDMRG it is however not possible to pin point the exact value of $V_{1}$ 
where the transition happens via finite size scaling due to the few cylinder sizes 
we have available, as discussed in section \ref{sec:modandmeth}.
%
However, from Fig.~\ref{} it is however possible to define a crossover region $1.4 \leq V_{1}\geq 2$,
consistent with the quantum Monte Carlo data, where the transition occurs.

\subsection{Cut B: SM--CMs}
%
The cut at $V_{1}=0.4$, labelled cut B in Fig.~\ref{fig:phasediagram}, 
probes the transition between the semimetal phase and the CMs phases.
%
In Fig.~\ref{fig:cut_V1_0.4} we present the entanglement entropy $S$ as a function of $V_{2}$
, the interaction that drives the phase transition.

\begin{figure}
 \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{{pdf/plot_cut_V1_0.4}.pdf}
 \caption{Entanglement entropy at $V_1=0.4$. \label{fig:cut_V1_0.4}}
\end{figure}
%
As expected from the previous analysis the entanglement entropy of 
the semimetal phase depends strongly on the MPS bond dimension $\chi$.
%
At $V_{2}\approx $ \noteAG{need value} we observe a sharp transition
to a decaying entanglement entropy that does not depend strongly on $\chi$
as $V_{2}$ is increased from the transtion.
%
This evidence is suggestive of a first order phase transition between
the semimetal and CMs phases.
%
The correlation length (not shown) also shows a discontinuity but not
as pronounced as the entanglement entropy.
%
\noteAG{Do we have a theory of why $S$ is better than $\chi$ sometimes?}

\subsection{Cut C: CMs--CDW-II}

In cut C we fix $V_{2}=3.6$ and study the phase transition between
the CMs and the CDW-II phases.
%
The entanglement entropy is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cut_V2_3.6} 
as a function of $V_{1}$.
\begin{figure}
 \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{{pdf/plot_cut_V2_3.6}.pdf}
 \caption{Entanglement entropy at $V_2=3.6$. \label{fig:cut_V2_3.6}}
\end{figure}
% 
%
This quantity shows a clear jump at $V_{2}\approx$ signalling a direct first order
phase transition between these two phases.
%
\noteAG{Is this expected semiclassically somehow?}

\subsection{Cut D: CDW-I--Kekul\'{e}--SM--CDW-II}

\begin{figure}
 \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{{pdf/plot_cut_V1_6}.pdf}
 \caption{Correlation length at $V_1=6$. \label{fig:cut_V1_6}}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Cut E: SM--CDW-III}

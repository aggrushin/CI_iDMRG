%
The emergence of the Haldane Chern insulator state due to strong short range electron-electron interactions in the half-filled spineless honeycomb lattice
model has been proposed and challenged with different methods since its proposal.
%
In this work we revisit the problem using the infinite density matrix renormalisation group method to go beyond existing mean field theory and exact
diagonalization studies that remain inconclusive so far.
%
We report numerical evidence supporting 
i) the absence of the Chern insulator state, 
ii) two previously unnoticed charge ordered phases, 
iii) the existence and stability of all the non-topological competing orders that were found previously within mean field.
iv) the first or second order character of the relevant phase transitions.
%
Our work establishes the phase diagram of the half-filled honeycomb lattice model tilting the balance
towards the absence of Chern insulator phase for this model.

\section{Introduction}
%
Topological phases of matter are remarkably robust states; their responses to external fields are
governed by topological invariants and thus many of their most important properties are insensitive to local perturbations~\cite{HK10,QZ11}.
%
Topologically protected responses result in intrinsically novel phenomena
including frationalization of quantum numbers~\cite{Nayak2008} or transport governed by quantum anomalies~\cite{V03}
and can lead to diverse applications, ranging from quantum computation to spintronics~\cite{HK10,QZ11,Nayak2008}.
%
Added to the remarkable experimental discoveries of new topological phases in both two and three dimensions,
these ideas have boosted a sustained and voluminous scientific effort in the last decade that attempts to classify them 
and determine when and how can they emerge~\cite{HK10,QZ11}.\\
\noteAG{Shorten, add other refs}
%

This work addresses the latter problem, in particular the possibility to induce a topological state from a trivial state via strong interactions.
%
The concrete question that we consider has so far
remained controversial: the realisation of the Chern insulator phases triggered by short-range electron-electron interactions in tight binding models.
%
The Chern insulator state, first identified by Haldane~\cite{H88} in the particular case of the honeycomb lattice, is a zero field analogue of the
integer quantum Hall effect; the Hall conductivity contribution of each band is quantised in integer units of $e^2/h$ and determined by a topological invariant, the Chern number.
%
Realising a Chern insulator in nature is not a trivial task; time-reversal must be broken with
the resulting magnetic flux averaging to zero over the unit cell, and thus over the entire sample.
%
In a remarkable proof of principle, a set of mean field studies~\cite{RQHZ08,WF10,GCC13} discussed how the Chern insulator can 
occur from electron-electron interactions. 
%
It was shown that spinless electrons hoping in the half-filled honeycomb lattice with nearest and next-to-nearest neighbour interactions, $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ respectively, 
displayed a Chern insulator phase as described by Haldane.
%
This particular realization of the Chern insulator phase has complex nearest neighbour hopings [see Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(g)]
and therefore within the mean field paradigm occurs in the region where $V_{2}>V_{1}$.
%
The latter condition 
was shown not to be a generic requirement; Chern insulator phases can be realized 
in mean field with only $V_{1}$ at the expense of enlarging the unit cell and doping the system~\cite{CGV11,GCC13}.
%
In addition, analogous topological phases have been obtained in other lattices such as the square lattice~\cite{WF10,JGC13}.
%

 %
 The exact nature of phase (c) was questioned within exact diagonalization by Ref.~\cite{DH14}.
 %
 \label{fig:orders}}
 %
\end{figure}
%
\\

The important question that still remains to be answered is wether the interaction induced Chern state survives 
after the effect of quantum fluctuations is included.
%
The Haldane Chern insulator phase competes with more conventional but also interesting orders, 
that can jeopardise its emergence and are depicted schematically in Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}.
%
On the one hand, in the $V_{1} \gg V_{2}$ limit, a charge ordered state depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(b) is expected, 
where the A and B sub lattices are populated differently~\cite{RQHZ08,WCT14} \noteAG{cite Monte Carlo refs}.
%
Being connected to the classical ground state at $V_{1}/t \to \infty$ with only one occupied sublattice, this state (CDW-I) has been found to be very robust both in mean field an exact diagonalization.
%
For $V_{2}\gg V_{1}$ on the other hand it was shown under the mean field paradigm~\cite{GCC13} that the phase space originally attributed to the Haldane Chern insulator 
was severely reduced by the presence of a sublattice charge modulated state (or CMs) depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(c).
%
The CMs phase was corroborated to survive quantum fluctuations in exact diagonalization~\cite{GGNVC13,DCH14} and within a variational Monte Carlo approach~\cite{DCH14}.
%
However, its exact nature was questioned by Ref.~\cite{DH14} where it was argued that a pinball liquid state~\cite{HF06,MRF13} --a state where a fraction of electrons remains pinned to fixed lattice sites while the remaining fermions explore the unoccupied sites-- cannot be discarded. 
%
In addition, at intermediate $V_{1}\sim V_{2}$ a Kekul\'e bond order~\cite{C00,HCM07,WF10,RH10,RJH13} depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(d), that triples the original honeycomb two atom unit cell, 
was found to be stable within mean field theory.
%
Although numerical evidence consistent with such bond order was found in exact diagonalization~\cite{GGNVC13}, further insights are needed to corroborate its existence in the thermodynamic limit.
%
Finally, the Haldane Chern insulator phase of Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(g), stable within mean field, was found however to be absent in exact diagonalization with periodic boundary conditions~\cite{GGNVC13,DH14} and cluster perturbation theory~\cite{DH14} suggesting that quantum fluctuations indeed can destabilize its emergence.
%
Nonetheless, this interpretation was challenged by Ref.~\cite{DCH14} that observed hints of this phase with exact diagonalization with open boundary conditions and variational Monte Carlo.\\

%
The contradictory numerical evidence regarding the existence of the Chern insulator phase in particular, and other competing phases in general, needs of an alternative approach
that includes quantum fluctuations while minimizing finite size effects.
%
In this work we therefore revisit the controversies left unsolved by previous studies using the infinite density matrix renormalization group method (iDMRG)~\cite{M08,W92,KZM13}. 
%
This variational method determines the ground-state of systems of size $L_{x} \times L_{y}$ where $L_{x}$ is in the thermodynamic limit and $L_{y}$ goes beyond
what is achievable in exact diagonalization.
%
We have mapped a $\left\lbrace V_{1},V_{2}\right\rbrace$ phase diagram for the half-filled honeycomb lattice in such an infinite cylinder geometry and our main findings are as follows.
%
First we show compelling numerical evidence that supports the absence of the Chern insulator state in a wide region of $\left\lbrace V_{1},V_{2}\right\rbrace$ phase space.
%
Second, we find two new phases not reported previously neither within mean field or exact diagonalization results and give a semiclassical argument for one 
of these to occur.
%
Third, we provide numerical support for the existence and stability of all the competing orders that were found previously within mean field.
%
In particular we characterise the two more controversial states, the CMs and Kekul\'{e} states, by computing bond and charge expectation values via the iDMRG method 
and present further arguments of the existence of the former from the semiclassical large interaction limit.
%
Fourth, we determine the first or second order character of the relevant phase transitions.
%
Concretely we address this issue by identifying the features that the correlation length $\xi$ and the entanglement entropy $S$ present as a function of $\left\lbrace V_{1},V_{2}\right\rbrace$.\\

This work is structured as follows. 
%
After describing the method and model in section~\ref{sec:modandmeth} we
characterise the different phases that we find in section~\ref{sec:phasediagram}.
%
The different phase transitions among them are analyzed in section~\ref{sec:phasetransitions}
and we end with a discussion and prospect of our results in section~\ref{sec:discconc}.

\section{\label{sec:modandmeth}Model and Method}
%
We investigate a system of spinless electrons hoping on a honeycomb lattice with real nearest neighbor hopping $t$ interacting via nearest and next to nearest neighbor interactions 
$\left\lbrace V_{1},V_{2}\right\rbrace$ respectively [see Fig.~\ref{fig:Defs}]. 
%
The Hamiltonian for this system can be written as
 %
\begin{equation}
%
 H:=-t\sum_{\left\langle i,j\right\rangle}(c^{\dagger}_{i}c^{\vphantom{\dagger}}_{j}+ \mathrm{h.c.})+
 %
V_{1}\sum_{\left\langle i,j\right\rangle }n_{i}n_{j}+
%
V_{2}\sum_{\left\langle \left\langle i,j\right\rangle \right\rangle }n_{i}n_{j}.
%
\label{eq:H}
\end{equation}
%
where $c_{i}^{\vphantom{\dagger}}$ $(c^{\dagger}_{i})$  annihilates (creates) an electron at the $i$-th site of the honeycomb lattice.
% in sublattice $s=A,B$ and $s\neq\bar{s}$. 
%
% Each of the two triangular sublattices A and B is spanned by the basis vectors
% $\bs{a}_{1}=\bs{\delta}_{2}-\bs{\delta}_{3}$ and 
% $\bs{a}_{2}=\bs{\delta}_{3}-\bs{\delta}_{1}$ defined through the three nearest neighbors $\bs{\delta}_{1}=a(0,-1)$,  
% $\bs{\delta}_{2}=a(\sqrt{3}/2,1/2)$ and $\bs{\delta}_{3}=a(-\sqrt{3}/2,+1/2)$ as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Defs}.\\
%
In order to find the ground state of the system in the $\left\lbrace V_{1},V_{2}\right\rbrace$ phase space
we use the infinite density matrix renormalization group algorithm (iDMRG) \cite{M08,W92,KZM13}.
%
Traditionally a method for finding the ground state of one-dimensional systems, it has been proven successful in numerous examples of two-dimensional systems in which the size in one dimension is kept finite~\cite{papers}\noteAG{maybe we want to move this to the intro and be more specific with examples}. 


A generic quantum state on a chain of length $N$~\noteAG{What chain? feels a bit of a jump in the explanation} can be written as a matrix product state (MPS) in the following form
%
\begin{equation}
%
 \ket{\psi} = \sum_{j_1, \ldots, j_N} A^{1 \left[j_1\right]} A^{2 \left[j_2\right]} \ldots A^{N \left[j_N\right]} \ket{j_1, \ldots, j_N}
 %
\end{equation}
%
where $A^{n \left[j_n\right]}$ is a $\chi_{n-1} \times \chi_n$ matrix, $\ket{j_n}$ are the local basis states on site $n$ and the $\chi_n$ are called bond dimensions
\noteAG{Here we define bond dimensions but then we refer to a single bond dimension. Maybe we need to clarify this a bit}. 
%
On an infinite chain, the state is represented by an infinite matrix product state (iMPS), that is, an infinite number of matrices. 
%
However, if the chain is translationally invariant, the matrices repeat themselves after translating the system by the length of one unit cell. 
%
Hence, specifying the set of matrices in one unit cell already completely represents the state. 
%
For an arbitrary state on an infinite chain, the bond dimensions are generically also infinite. 
\noteAG{the last three sentences try to explain something that either needs more space to be explained for it to be clear
or not be mentioned at all and referred to an iDMRG paper like Jonas's, Frank's and Jens's for details}
%
Nevertheless, the ground state of gapped systems can be approximated to any required precision by matrices of a finite bond dimension that grows with the entanglement between two semi-infinite halves of the system. \noteJM{Scaling and references}\noteAG{Can we try to explain briefly why this is so?}

\noteAG{I think this next paragraph can benefit from a topic sentence, i.e. a sentence that kind of summaries the paragraph before going into details.
Also, we might want to reconsider how we say things. I would say first that we can do any size from L=6 to L=12, then say that some of them allow for K and K', then that we use 
L=6,12. In other words, explaining from the more general things to the more particular choice we compute, right now is the opposite.}
We investigate the model on an infinite cylinder geometry and choose a unit cell of three rings of $L=12$ sites wrapping around the cylinder as depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:Defs}. 
%
This size secures that all the possible orders that occur in the range of our study are commensurate with the iMPS unit cell. 
%
Another reason to choose this size originates from the single particle momentum discretization in the $y$-direction around the cylinder. 
%
In the non-interacting case, the model forms a Dirac semimetal with the Fermi surface consisting of the $K$ and $K^{\prime}$ points which possess momenta $k_y=k_y^{\prime} = 2\pi / 3$. 
%
Only if these two points are allowed momenta of the investigated system, the low energy physics can be captured correctly. 
%
This means that from the feasible system sizes only $L=6$ and $12$ are well suited for our purposes whereas $L=8$ and $10$ do not include the momenta of the $K$ and $K^{\prime}$ points.

\section{\label{sec:phasediagram}Phase diagram}
%
We have used the iDMRG method presented in the previous section
to find the groundstate of the half-filled honeycomb lattice in the presence of 
$\left\lbrace V_{1},V_{2}\right\rbrace$ interactions.
%
Our results are summarised in the phase diagram presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}.
%
As a function of $\left\lbrace V_{1},V_{2}\right\rbrace$ we find six different phases, 
including two novel charge order phases (CDW-II and CDW-III) together with the previously 
reported Kekul\'{e}, CMs, CDW-I and semimetal phases.
%
We describe next their corresponding charge and bond ordering patterns and how these
are characterised within the iDMRG method.
%

 %

 %
 The state shows a uniform density but the hopping amplitudes break translational symmetry and form a six site unit cell. \label{fig:phase diagram}
 \noteAG{The axes of the figure should be $V_{1,2}/t$}}
\end{figure*}




%
\subsection{Semimetal phase (SM)}
%
We start by discussing the semimetal phase, labelled SM in the phase diagram shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}.
%
This phase is continuously connected to the gapless non-interacting state $V_{1}=V_{2}=0$; 
it is a uniform renormalization of the hopping strength $t$ by interactions.
%
Therefore it is a a single particle gapless state that lacks both charge and bond order and is described by a low energy theory in terms of two massless Dirac fermions.
%
In such low energy picture and within the renormalisation group approach, the stability of the semimetal phase in the region $\left\lbrace V_{1},V_{2}\right\rbrace \lesssim t$ is expected.
%
Short range interactions are irrelevant~\cite{S94} and therefore they can only drive a transition to an ordered state when they have a magnitude comparable to the nearest neighbour hopping strength $t$.\\
%

%
Within the iDMRG algorithm we have characterised the semimetal phase in two distinct ways.
%
Firstly we compute the charge and bond ground state expectation values.
%
On the one hand, at each site the charge expectation value is defined by 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:charge}
n_{i,s}=\left\langle c^{\dagger}_{i,s}c_{i,s}\right\rangle,  
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $s=A,B$ is the sublattice index.
%
To numerical accuracy we find that $n_{i,A}=n_{i,B}=1/2$, indicating that this phase is not charge ordered.
%

The bond ground state expectation value on the other hand is defined as
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:bond}
t^{s,s'}_{i,j}=\left\langle c^{\dagger}_{i,s}c_{j,s'}\right\rangle.
\end{eqnarray}
%
For $i,j$ being nearest neighbours we find a small ($10^{-2}$ \noteAG{number needed}) asymmetry
between bonds pointing along and around the cylinder axis.
%
Such asymmetry should vanish in a perfect semimetallic phase and indeed it is severely reduced as the bond dimension $\chi$ is increased.
% 
This suggests that the cylinder geometry implemented in iDMRG artificially differentiates bonds in its two perpendicular directions,
since it vanishes as $\chi$ is reduced, and is not a physical effect.
%
The uniform bond and charge distribution is consistent with the semimetalic state.

\noteJM{From here on, it's more what we would like to see, but don't since DMRG is not well behaved in a critical phase. All we can say, is that the entire region is one phase and doesn't have any features, hence, semimetal.}
%
Secondly, and to further confirm the semimetalic nature of the state, we have computed the low energy structure of the many-body 
entanglement spectrum of this phase, to find that its low energy structure coincides with that of the parent non-interacting critical state.\\

%%
%Moreover, we note that the semimetal phase is a critical state and thus in principle requires an infinite $\chi$ to represent the state.
%%
%This leads us to the second approach to characterise the semimetal phase that makes use of the its criticality.
%%
%For a critical phase the entanglement entropy is expected to show a logarithmic growth with the correlation length.
%\noteAG{eqn needed}
%%
%The proportionality constant $c/3$ defines the central charge of the theory $c$. 
%%
%The semimetal has two Dirac cones and therefore it is expected that $c=2$. 
%%
%In the appendix...
%\noteAG{This last paragraph can be removed if we don't need it}


%
We finally note that this state seems to extend beyond what is expected from mean field theory~\cite{RQHZ08,WF10,GCC13} towards
higher interaction strengths.
%
We leave the discussion regarding this difference for the discussion in section \ref{sec:discconc}.

\subsection{Charge density wave (CDW-I)}
%
The second state we identify is a charge density wave state labelled CDW-I in the phase diagram of Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}.
%
This state has a two site unit cell that is characterised by a finite order parameter
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:CDW}
%
M=\left\langle n_{A} \right\rangle-\left\langle n_{B}\right\rangle,
%
\end{equation}
%
where $n_{A}$ and $n_{B}$ are the density of electrons in the $A$ and $B$ sublattice sites of the two site unit cell respectively.
%
We show a representative charge pattern of this phase Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}(d) for $V_{1}/t = 4$ and $V_{2}/t = 0.4$ 
calculated numerically using \eqref{eq:charge}.
%
As evident from this figure there is an appreciable sublattice charge imbalance, i.e. $M\neq 0$, that we observe throughout this phase.
%
The magnitude of $M$ increases with $V_{1}$ and to numerical accuracy this phase has no appreciable bond order.\\
%

For large $V_{1}\gg t$ such a state is a natural instability since the energy is minimised by a charge imbalance between the two sub lattices.
%
Indeed, it has been found in a mean field approximation~\cite{RQHZ08,WF10,GCC13}, exact diagonalization~\cite{GGNVC13,DH14,DCH14}, 
and quantum Monte Carlo simulations~\cite{WCT14}.
%


\subsection{Sub-lattice charge modulated phase (CMs)}
%
For large $V_{2}\ll t$ the ground state is classically degenerate. 
%
Within mean field it was shown that as long $V_{2}>V_{1}$
the system chose a charge ordered pattern with charge modulation over different sub lattices, termed the CMs phase~\cite{GCC13}.
%
Such order, schematically shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(c), has a six site unit cell, and minimises the large cost
attributed to $V_{2}$ by reversing two nearest neighbour dimers at the expense of paying the small energetic cost
determined by $V_{1}$.
%
Within exact diagonalization it has been argued that the CMs state survives quantum fluctuations~\cite{GGNVC13,DH14,DCH14} 
but its nature was challenged in Ref.~\onlinecite{DH14} suggesting that a pinball like state~\cite{HF06,MRF13} cannot be ruled out.\\
%
With the iDMRG method we find that directly above the semimetallic phase the CMs occurs [see Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}] .
%
A sample of the six site unit cell charge pattern for obtained from \eqref{eq:charge} for $V_1/t = 0.8, V_2/t = 3.2 $ is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}(a).
%
We find that this pattern, with the bond ordering associated to the charge order survives in the region labelled CMs of the phase diagram.
%
Such a state coincides with that obtained within mean field theory~\cite{GCC13} depicted schematically in Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(c).

% 
Moreover, we now show that the CMs state is expected from a semi-classical analysis as well.
%
For instance, for a given cluster, it is possible to find the number and energy of all the degenerate classical states, assuming $V_{2}\gg t$.
%
Within this approach, the hopping can be introduced as a perturbation $t$ to find how the degeneracy is lifted.
\noteAG{Maybe Fernando can rewrite these two paragraphs better. We may want to be more specific about order parameters etc.} 


\subsection{Kekul\'{e} bond order}
%
The next phase we identify is the Kekul\'{e}
bond order.
%
Like the CMs, it has a six site unit cell depicted schematically in Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(d)
with uniform charge order and strong and weak bonds.
%
Under the mean field approximation the state arises between the CMs and the CDW-I state.
%
Although in exact diagonalization hints of this state are also observed,
the evidence supporting its occurrence is far from conclusive~\cite{GGNVC13} since
its tripled unit cell turns the analysis of larger clusters problematic.
%

Within iDMRG we find that these state is stable in a smaller but finite region compared to both 
exact diagonalization and mean field.
%
We show the state's numerically obtained charge and bond order patterns in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}(e) and (d) 
calculated with \eqref{eq:charge} \eqref{eq:bond} respectively.
%
The state has indeed two types of bonds (weak and strong) arranged as in Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(d) 
and no charge order.
%
For instance for $V_{1}/t=$ and $V_{2}/t=$



\subsection{Charge density wave - II (CDW-II)}
%
All phases that we have described so far do not differ
from those predicted by mean field and exact diagonalization.
%
At high $V_{2}$ but with sufficiently large $V_{1}$ we observe that
a twelve site unit cell charge order depicted schematically in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(e) emerges.
%
We show the numerically obtained charge order in 
Fig.~\cite{fig:phase diagram} (b)
%


\subsection{Charge density wave - III (CDW-III)}
%



\section{\label{sec:phasetransitions} Phase transitons}
%
A crucial advantage of the iDMRG method is that, unlike finite
size methods such as exact diagonalization it can characterize the order of phase transitions.
%
In order to unravel the character of the phase transitions between
the phases described above we now study two quantities that are sensitive
to a phase change, the entanglement entropy $S$ and the correlation length $\xi$.
%
In Fig.~\ref{}  and Fig.~\ref{} we show how these quantities change along
the horizontal and vertical cuts depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram} respectively.
%

\subsection{Cut A: SM--CDW-I}

The first horizontal cut, labelled A addresses the character of the phase transition between the semi-metallic
phase and the simplest charge density wave (CDW-I) by fixing $V_{2}=0$.
%
This phase transition has been previously addressed with the quantum Monte-Carlo method~\ref{WCT14} 
and was determined to be of second order character.
%
The transition point with divergent correlation length was determined to be at $V_{1}=$ via finite size scaling.
\noteAG{need number and polishing, Johannes?}
%
In Fig.~\ref{fig:cut_V2_0} we show the correlation length as a function of $V_{1}$ 
for different values of the bond dimension $\chi$ and cylinder with $L=12$ circumference.
\begin{figure}
 \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{{pdf/plot_cut_V2_0}.pdf}
 \label{fig:cut_V2_0}
 \caption{Correlation length at $V_2=0$.  \noteAG{could it be useful to show the order parameter M
 as a function of $V_{1}$ in the same plot (using the right vertical axis?). It might get to crowded)}}
\end{figure}
% 
%
Firstly, for $V_{1}\leq 1.5t$ we observe that the correlation length diverges as the bond
dimension of the MPS is increased.
%
This behaviour is expected for a critical state such as the semimetal phase;  
the logarithmic divergence of entanglement of a metallic state requires an MPS with $\chi\to\infty$.
%
For $V_{1}\geq 1.5t$ the correlation length drops significantly and has no longer a significant 
dependence on $\chi$.
%
This is characteristic of a gapped phase such as the charge density wave.
%
The crossover is smooth, signalling a second order phase transition, in agreement with 
quantum Monte Carlo studies.
%
With iDMRG it is however not possible to pin point the exact value of $V_{1}$ 
where the transition happens via finite size scaling due to the few cylinder sizes 
we have available, as discussed in section \ref{sec:modandmeth}.
%
However, from Fig.~\ref{} it is however possible to define a crossover region $1.4 \leq V_{1}\geq 2$,
consistent with the quantum Monte Carlo data, where the transition occurs.

\subsection{Cut B: SM--CMs}
%
The cut at $V_{1}=0.4$, labelled cut B in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}, 
probes the transition between the semimetal phase and the CMs phases.
%
In Fig.~\ref{fig:cut_V1_0.4} we present the entanglement entropy $S$ as a function of $V_{2}$
, the interaction that drives the phase transition.

%
As expected from the previous analysis the entanglement entropy of 
the semimetal phase depends strongly on the MPS bond dimension $\chi$.
%
At $V_{2}\approx $ \noteAG{need value} we observe a sharp transition
to a decaying entanglement entropy that does not depend strongly on $\chi$
as $V_{2}$ is increased from the transtion.
%
This evidence is suggestive of a first order phase transition between
the semimetal and CMs phases.
%
The correlation length (not shown) also shows a discontinuity but not
as pronounced as the entanglement entropy.
%
\noteAG{Do we have an idea of why $S$ is better than $\xi$ sometimes to show phase transitions?}

\subsection{Cut C: CMs--CDW-II}

In cut C we fix $V_{2}=3.6$ and study the phase transition between
the CMs and the CDW-II phases.
%
The entanglement entropy is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cut_V2_3.6} 
as a function of $V_{1}$.
\begin{figure}

 \caption{Entanglement entropy at $V_2=3.6$. \label{fig:cut_V2_3.6}}
\end{figure}
% 
%
This quantity shows a clear jump at $V_{2}\approx$ signalling a direct first order
phase transition between these two phases.
%
\noteAG{Is this expected semi-classically somehow?}

\section{\label{sec:discconc}Discussion and Conclusions}
%

The spontaneous emergence of the Chern insulator phase due to interactions in the half-filled spineless honeycomb lattice
model has been proposed and challenged with different methods since its proposal~\cite{RQHZ08,WF10,GCC13,GGNVC13,DH14,DCH14}.
%
In this work we have gone beyond mean field and exact diagnoalization by using the iDMRG method that allows for quantum fluctuations
to play a role but minimising the finite size effects due its intrinsic infinite cylinder geometry.\\

One of our main results is the absence of the Haldane Chern insulator state in this model.
%
It seems therefore that quantum fluctuations indeed jeopardize its emergence and work against
the naive mean field expectations.
%
Although there is no reason to believe that the situation is different for the $\pi-$flux model, that also hosts a
mean field Chern insulating phase that is absent in exact diagonalization~\cite{WF10,JGC13}, 
there is more hope for other frustrated models.
%
In particular, the interacting Kagome lattice hosts a Chern insulator state when the filling is tuned to
the quadratic band point touching between the flat band and one of the two dispersive bands.
%
Its presence is predicted within the renormalization group approach~\cite{SF08,SYF09} and thus not finding this state 
can only be attributed to an artefact of the method.\\

In this work we have theoretically predicted two novel competing phases, the CDW-II and CDW-III.
%
These states are topologically trivial charge ordered states that have a twelve site unit cell.
%
The latter fact results in them being more elusive for exact diagonalization and mean field studies to identify them
and explains why they have not been reported before.
%
The CDW-II in particular can be understood...

We have understood the CMs phase state as occurring from perturbation theory
%




\noteAG{We might want to comment what determines if $S$ or $\xi$ gives better signatures of phase transitions. \\}

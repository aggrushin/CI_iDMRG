%
%
The emergence of the Haldane Chern insulator state due to strong short range repulsive interactions in the half-filled fermionic spinless honeycomb lattice
model has been proposed and challenged with different methods and yet it still remains controversial.
%
In this work we revisit the problem using the infinite density matrix renormalization group method to go beyond previous mean field theory and exact
diagonalization studies.
%
We report numerical evidence supporting 
i) the absence of the Chern insulator state, 
ii) two previously unnoticed charge ordered phases
and iii) the existence and stability of all the non-topological competing orders that were found previously within mean field.
%
In addition, we discuss the nature of the corresponding phase transitions based on our numerical data.
%
Our work establishes the phase diagram of the half-filled honeycomb lattice model tilting the balance
towards the absence of a Chern insulator phase for this model.

\section{Introduction}
%
Topological phases of matter are remarkably robust states; their responses to external fields are
governed by topological invariants and thus many of their most important properties are insensitive to local perturbations~\cite{HK10,QZ11}.
%
Topologically protected responses result in intrinsically novel phenomena
including fractionalization of quantum numbers~\cite{Nayak2008} or transport governed by quantum anomalies~\cite{V03}
and can lead to diverse applications, ranging from fault tolerant quantum computation to spintronics~\cite{HK10,QZ11,Nayak2008}.
%
Added to the remarkable experimental discoveries of new topological phases in both two and three dimensions,
these ideas have boosted a sustained and voluminous scientific effort in the last decade that attempts to classify them 
and determine when and how can they emerge~\cite{S14}.\\
%
This work addresses a concrete question regarding the emergence of topological phases that has so far remained controversial: 
the existence of the Chern insulator phase triggered by short range repulsive interactions in the
fermonic spinless half-filled honeycomb tight binding model.
%
The Chern insulator state, first identified by Haldane~\cite{H88} in the particular case of the honeycomb lattice, is a zero field analogue of the
integer quantum Hall effect; the Hall conductivity contribution of each band is quantized in integer units of $e^2/h$ and determined by a topological invariant, the Chern number.
%
Realising a Chern insulator in nature is not a trivial task~\cite{CZF13}; time-reversal must be broken with
the resulting magnetic flux averaging to zero over the unit cell, and hence over the entire sample.\\
%
In a proof of principle, a set of mean field studies~\cite{RQHZ08,WF10,PR12,GCC13} 
discussed how the Chern insulator can emerge from repulsive short range interactions. 
%
It was shown that spinless fermions hopping in the half-filled honeycomb lattice with nearest and next-to-nearest neighbor interactions, $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ respectively 
[see Fig.~\ref{fig:Defs}], displayed a Chern insulator phase as described by Haldane~\cite{H88}.
%
The non-interacting realization of this Chern insulator phase has complex next-to-nearest neighbor hoppings [see Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(g)].
%
Within the mean field paradigm it occurs in a region with $V_{2}>V_{1}$ where $V_{2}$ spontaneously breaks time reversal symmetry 
generating complex next-to-nearest neighbor hopping strengths.
%
The latter condition was shown not to be a generic requirement; Chern insulator phases can be realized 
in mean field with only $V_{1}$ at the expense of enlarging the unit cell and doping the system~\cite{CGV11,GCC13}.
%
In addition, analogous topological phases have been obtained in other lattices such as the $\pi-$flux model~\cite{WF10,JGC13} and the Kagome lattice~\cite{WRW10}.

The important question that still remains to be answered is whether the interaction induced Chern state survives 
after the effect of quantum fluctuations is included.
%
The Haldane Chern insulator phase competes with more conventional but also interesting orders, 
that can jeopardize its emergence and are depicted schematically in Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}.
%
In the $V_{1} \gg V_{2}$ limit, a charge ordered state depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(b) is expected, 
where the A and B sublattices are populated differently~\cite{RQHZ08,WCT14}.
%
Being connected to the classical ground state at $V_{1}/t \to \infty$ with only one occupied sublattice, this state (CDW I) has been found to be very robust both in mean field and exact diagonalization~\cite{GGNVC13,DH14}.
%
For $V_{2}\gg V_{1}$ on the other hand it was shown under the mean field paradigm~\cite{GCC13} that the phase space originally attributed to the Haldane Chern insulator 
was severely reduced by the presence of a sublattice charge modulated state (or CMs) depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(c).
%
The CMs phase was corroborated to survive quantum fluctuations in exact diagonalization~\cite{GGNVC13,DH14,DCH14} 
and within a variational Monte Carlo approach~\cite{DCH14}.
%
The exact nature of the phase was further discussed in Ref.~\cite{DH14} by computing the charge structure factor; 
its suppressed Fourier component at $\Gamma$ suggested the absence of charge imbalance between the sublattices and 
was therefore termed CM phase.
%
In addition, at intermediate $V_{1}\gtrsim V_{2}$ a Kekul\'e bond order~\cite{C00,HCM07,RH10,RJH13} 
depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(d) was found to be stable within mean field theory~\cite{WF10}.
%
This three-fold degenerate bond order triples the original honeycomb two atom unit cell breaking its translational symmetry.
%
Although numerical evidence consistent with such bond order was found in exact diagonalization~\cite{GGNVC13}, further insights are needed to corroborate its existence in the thermodynamic limit.
%
Finally, the Haldane Chern insulator phase of Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(g), stable within mean field, was found however to be absent in exact diagonalization with periodic boundary conditions~\cite{GGNVC13,DH14} and cluster perturbation theory~\cite{DH14} suggesting that quantum fluctuations indeed can destabilize its emergence.
%
Nonetheless, this interpretation was challenged by Ref.~\cite{DCH14} that observed hints of this phase in exact diagonalization with open boundary conditions and variational Monte Carlo.\\

 (e) CDW II, (f) CDW III and (g) Haldane Chern insulator phases. 
 %
 Phases (a)-(d) and (g) were found within mean field theory by Refs.~\cite{RQHZ08,WF10,GCC13}.

The survival of the Haldane Chern insulator phase (g) was challenged within exact diagonalization with periodic boundary conditions
by Refs.~\cite{GGNVC13,DH14} but found in Ref.~\cite{DCH14} for open boundary conditions.

 %
\end{figure}
%
The contradictory numerical evidence regarding the existence of the Chern insulator phase in particular, and other competing phases in general, needs of an alternative approach
that includes quantum fluctuations while minimizing finite size effects.
%
In this work we therefore revisit the controversies left unsolved by previous studies using the infinite density matrix renormalization group method (iDMRG)~\cite{M08,W92,KZM13}. 
%
This variational method determines the ground state of systems of size $L_{x} \times L_{y}$ where $L_{x}$ is in the thermodynamic limit and $L_{y}$ goes beyond
what is achievable in exact diagonalization.
%
Traditionally a method for finding the ground state of one-dimensional systems,
iDMRG has recently been successfully applied to two-dimensional systems.
%
The infinite and finite DMRG method were indeed shown to be able to characterize the properties of fractional quantum Hall~\cite{ZMP13},
$\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid~\cite{HSC14}, chiral spin liquid \cite{HSC14b} and bosonic and fermionic fractional Chern insulating states~\cite{JWB12,CV13,ZKB13,GMZ15}.
%
As long as entanglement remains low and the state has short correlation lengths the ground state
can be represented faithfully by a product of matrices --termed matrix product state (MPS)-- of a computationally affordable
dimension $\chi$, known as the bond dimension~\cite{M08,W92,KZM13}.
%
This requirement is commonly met by gapped systems and in particular by the orders argued above to be expected instabilities in the half-filled 
honeycomb lattice of interest here.
%
Moreover, the iDMRG method deals with an infinite system and thus, given a suitable size of the unit cell used for the simulations, it can directly probe ground states that spontaneously break the original symmetries of the hamiltonian and the phase transitions among them, while allowing for quantum fluctuations to play a role. 
%
\\
 
%
Motivated by these advantages we have mapped out the $\left\lbrace V_{1},V_{2}\right\rbrace$ phase diagram for the half-filled honeycomb lattice in the infinite cylinder geometry
with the iDMRG method [see Fig.~\ref{fig:Defs}].
%
Our main findings are summarized next.
%
First we show compelling numerical evidence that supports the absence of the Chern insulator state in a wide region of $\left\lbrace V_{1},V_{2}\right\rbrace$ phase space.
%
Second, we find two new phases not reported previously neither within mean field~\cite{RQHZ08,WF10,GCC13} 
nor the first exact diagonalization results~\cite{GGNVC13,DH14,DCH14} and analyze their semiclassical features.
%
Third, we provide numerical support for the existence and stability of all the competing orders that were found previously within mean field.
%
In particular we characterize the two more controversial states, the CMs and Kekul\'{e} states, by computing bond and charge expectation values
and present further arguments of the existence of the former from the semiclassical large interaction limit.
%
Fourth, we provide numerical evidence to assess the first or second order character of the relevant phase transitions.
%
Concretely we address this issue by identifying the features that the correlation length $\xi$ and the entanglement entropy $S$ present as a function of $\left\lbrace V_{1},V_{2}\right\rbrace$.\\

This work is structured as follows. 
%
After describing the method and model in section~\ref{sec:modandmeth} we
characterize the different phases that we find in section~\ref{sec:phasediagram}.
%
The corresponding phase transitions among them are analyzed in section~\ref{sec:phasetransitions}
and we end with a discussion and prospect of our results in section~\ref{sec:discconc}.
%
Appendix \ref{sec:appendix} includes details of our semiclassical analysis as well a discussion of the CMs state order parameter.


\section{\label{sec:modandmeth}Model and Method}
%
We investigate a system of spinless fermions hopping on a honeycomb lattice with real nearest neighbor hopping $t\ge0$ interacting via nearest and next to nearest neighbor interactions 
$\left\lbrace V_{1},V_{2}\right\rbrace \ge \lbrace 0,0 \rbrace  $ respectively [see Fig.~\ref{fig:Defs}]. 
%
The Hamiltonian for this system can be written as
 %
\begin{equation}
%
 H=-t\sum_{\left\langle i,j\right\rangle}(c^{\dagger}_{i}c^{\vphantom{\dagger}}_{j}+ \mathrm{h.c.})+
 %
V_{1}\sum_{\left\langle i,j\right\rangle }n_{i}n_{j}+
%
V_{2}\sum_{\left\langle \left\langle i,j\right\rangle \right\rangle }n_{i}n_{j},
%
\label{eq:H}
\end{equation}
%
where $c_{i}^{\vphantom{\dagger}}$ $(c^{\dagger}_{i})$  annihilates (creates) an electron at the $i$-th site of the honeycomb lattice.\\
%
In order to find the ground state of the system in the $\left\lbrace V_{1},V_{2}\right\rbrace$ phase space
we employ the iDMRG algorithm~\cite{M08,W92,KZM13} on an infinite cylinder geometry [see Fig.~\ref{fig:Defs}].
%
As discussed above, such infinite geometry allows to probe ground states with spontaneous 
symmetry breaking while taking into account quantum fluctuations.
%
Feasible system sizes for our purposes are cylinders of circumference $L_{y} = 6,8,10$ and $12$, 
given the exponential growth of computational cost with the circumference.
%
For our calculations we choose $L_y=12$ and a unit cell of 36 sites depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:Defs}.
%

We pick this geometry for the following two reasons.
%
First, we have to keep in mind the structure of the reciprocal space.
%
Since we work in the thermodynamic limit in the $x$-direction along the cylinder, the momentum in $x$-direction is a continuous quantity.
%
However in the finite $y$-direction around the cylinder, the momentum is a discrete variable.
%
In the non-interacting case, the model forms a Dirac semimetal and the Fermi surface is located at the 
$\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{K}^{\prime}$ points~\cite{CastroNeto2009}.
%
In order to capture the low energy physics correctly, it is of key importance that $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{K}^{\prime}$ are allowed momenta in our unit cell which implies that only $L_y=6$ and $12$ are suitable circumferences of our cylinder.
%
Second, we have the freedom of fixing the length of our unit cell in the $x$-direction since the computational for that only scales linearly.
%
By choosing three rings of 12 sites, all orders are commensurate with our unit cell and a further enlargement would not lead to different results in the parameter region we investigated.
%
All data we show in the remainder of the text is computed for $L_y = 12$ and bond dimension $\chi = 1600$ unless otherwise stated.


\section{\label{sec:phasediagram}Phase diagram}
%
We have mapped the phase diagram as a function of $\left\lbrace V_{1},V_{2}\right\rbrace$ with the method described above.
%
Our main results are summarized in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}.
%
We find six different phases: two novel charge order phases labeled CDW II and CDW III and four previously 
reported mean field orders, the Kekul\'{e}, CMs, CDW I and semimetal phases.\\
%
We have characterized each phase through their charge and bond ground state
expectation values.
%
At each site the charge expectation value is defined by 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:charge}
n_{i}=\left\langle c^{\dagger}_{i}c_{i}\right\rangle.
\end{eqnarray}
%
The bond ground state expectation value on the other hand is defined as
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:bond}
t_{ij}=\left\langle c^{\dagger}_{i}c_{j}+\mathrm{h.c.}\right\rangle.
\end{eqnarray}
%
Next we discuss the features of the different phases in the phase diagram in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}.


\begin{figure*}
 \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{pdf/phase_diagram_ext.pdf}
 \caption{Left: Phase diagram obtained with iDMRG calculations on an infinte cylinder of circumference $L_{y}=12, \, \chi = 1600$. 
 %
 Right: Representative charge and bond strength patterns for the four phases with largest unit cell discussed in the main text. 
 %
 The area of the blue circles is proportional to the particle number expectation value on the respective site given by Eq. \eqref{eq:charge}. 
 %
 The thickness of the ellipsoids on the bonds is proportional to the amplitude $t_{ij}$ between nearest neighbors defined by Eq.~\eqref{eq:bond}.
 %

 %
 These correspond to (a) CMs phase with $V_1/t = 0.8, V_2/t = 3.2 $, (b) Kekul\'e phase with $V_1/t = 5.6, V_2/t = 1.6 $, (c) CDW II phase with $V_1/t = 5.6, V_2/t = 3.2$,  
 (d) CDW III phase with $V_1/t = 9.2, V_2/t = 2.5$. 
 %
 \label{fig:phase diagram}}
\end{figure*}


%

\subsection{Semimetal phase \label{subsec:SM}}
%
We start by discussing the semimetal phase in the phase diagram shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}.
%
At $V_{1}/t=V_{2}/t=0$ the honeycomb lattice with nearest neighbor hopping its 
known to be described by a low energy theory in terms of two massless Dirac fermions~\cite{CastroNeto2009}.
%
Short range interactions are irrelevant in the renormalization group sense~\cite{S94,KUP12} 
and therefore they can only drive a transition to an ordered state when they have a magnitude comparable to the nearest neighbor hopping strength $t$.
%
Such perturbative analysis guarantees that the semimetal is stable within
the region $\left\lbrace V_{1},V_{2}\right\rbrace \lesssim t$, only allowing for a uniform renormalization 
of the hopping strength $t$ by interactions.\\

%
For the semimetal phase in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}, and to numerical accuracy, we find by computing the charge expectation value
\eqref{eq:charge} that $n_{i}=1/2$ for all sites, indicating that this phase is not charge ordered.\\
%
From \eqref{eq:bond} and choosing $i,j$ to be nearest neighbors we find
a small asymmetry between bonds pointing along and around the cylinder axis,
with a relative difference of $\sim10^{-2}$.
%
Such asymmetry should vanish in a perfect semimetallic phase and indeed it is severely reduced as the bond dimension $\chi$ is increased.
% 
This suggests that the cylinder geometry implemented in iDMRG artificially differentiates bonds in its two perpendicular directions.
%
The asymmetry vanishes as $\chi$ is increased and thus it is not a physical effect.
%
This is consistent with a semimetal state; the logarithmic divergence of entanglement of a metallic state requires a matrix product state with $\chi\to\infty$. 
%
The bond asymmetry reduces the entanglement by shifting the Dirac cones away from the $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{K'}$ points~\cite{ACJ15}.\\
%
%
Together, the previous numerical evidence are consistent with the semimetallic state.
%
We note that numerically the semimetal state extends beyond $\left\lbrace V_{1},V_{2}\right\rbrace \lesssim t$ towards
higher interaction strengths through a narrow semimetal trench in the phase diagram.
%
The larger size of this region at $L_{y}=6$ (not shown) suggest that it is likely to shrink as the circumference of the cylinder is increased but
a definitive statement requires going beyond the numerically accessible sizes. 
%

\subsection{Charge density wave I (CDW I)}
%
Upon increasing $V_{1}$ we identify a charge density wave state labeled CDW I in the phase diagram of Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}.
%
This state has a two site unit cell and is characterized by a finite order parameter of symmetry $B_2$ under the symmetry group $C_{6v}''$ \cite{Basko08}
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:CDW}
%
B_2=\left\langle n_{A} \right\rangle-\left\langle n_{B}\right\rangle,
%
\end{equation}
%
that can be calculated using \eqref{eq:charge}, where $n_{A}$ and $n_{B}$ are the fermion densities in the $A$ and $B$ sublattice sites of the two site unit cell respectively. 
%
The resulting charge order is depicted schematically in Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(b). 
%
For instance, at $V_{1}/t = 4$ and $V_{2}/t = 0.4$ we find that $B_2=0.817$.
%
The magnitude of $B_2$ increases with $V_{1}$ and to numerical accuracy this phase has no appreciable bond order.\\
%s
For large $V_{1}\gg t$ such a state is a natural instability since the energy is minimized by a charge imbalance between the two sublattices.
%
Indeed, it has been found in a mean field approximation~\cite{RQHZ08,WF10,GCC13}, exact diagonalization~\cite{GGNVC13,DH14,DCH14}, 
and quantum Monte Carlo simulations~\cite{WCT14}.
%

\subsection{Sublattice charge modulated phase (CMs)}
%
For small $t \ll V_{2}$ the ground state is classically degenerate. 
%
Within mean field it was shown that as long as $V_{2}>V_{1}$ the system chooses a charge ordered pattern with charge modulation 
of wavevector $\mathbf{K}$ or $\mathbf{K}'$, termed the CMs phase~\cite{GCC13} and depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(c). 
%
The order parameters for any such modulation can be taken as the corresponding Fourier components of the charge expectation values of Eq.~\eqref{eq:charge},
namely $\left\langle n_{A,B}(\mathbf{K}) \right\rangle = \left\langle n_{A,B}(\mathbf{K}') \right\rangle^*$, where A and B indicate the two sublattices.
%
It is convenient to arrange these order parameters in a basis that has well defined transformation properties under the symmetry of the lattice.
%
Under the action of the symmetry group $C_{6v}''$, these order parameters transform as the four dimensional $G'$ representation \cite{Basko08,deJuan13}
%
\begin{align}
G_{1x}' = {\rm Re}[n_{A}(\mathbf{K}) -n_{B}(\mathbf{K})], \\
G_{1y}' =  {\rm Im}[n_{A}(\mathbf{K}) -n_{B}(\mathbf{K})], \\
G_{2x}' =  {\rm Im}[n_{A}(\mathbf{K}) +n_{B}(\mathbf{K})], \\
G_{2y}' =  {\rm Re}[n_{A}(\mathbf{K}) +n_{B}(\mathbf{K})].
\end{align}
%
The CMs state corresponds to a finite expectation value of both the $B_2$ order parameter and $G' = (1,0,0,0)$ and the states generated from these by operations of the symmetry group. 
%
A scalar order parameter for the CMs phase can be defined as $B_2 {\rm Re}[(G_1')^3-3G_1'(G_2')^2]$, where $G_i' = G_{ix}'+iG_{iy}'$ (see appendix A).
%
The CMs structure is schematically shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(c). 
%
It minimizes the large cost attributed to $V_{2}$ by reversing two nearest neighbor dimers at the expense of paying the small energetic cost determined by $V_{1}$.
%
Within exact diagonalization it has been argued that the CMs state survives quantum fluctuations~\cite{GGNVC13,DH14,DCH14}.
% 
However, the sublattice charge imbalance predicted in mean field~\cite{GCC13} was suggested to vanish in Ref.~\onlinecite{DH14} 
due to the absence of an enhanced Fourier component of the charge structure factor at the $\Gamma$ point.
%
We note that the CMs scalar order parameter defined above quantifies the charge imbalance since $B_{2}$ has to be non-zero for it not to vanish.\\
%
With the iDMRG method we find that the CMs appears directly above the semimetallic phase~[see Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}].
%
A sample of the six site unit cell charge and bond pattern obtained from \eqref{eq:charge} for $V_1/t = 0.8, V_2/t = 3.2 $ is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}(a).
%
The circles at each site have an area proportional to the strength of the charge at the given site, while the thickness of the links between the sites represent the bond strengths.
%
This bond and charge pattern survives in the region labeled CMs of the phase diagram and coincides with that obtained within mean field theory~\cite{GCC13} depicted schematically in Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(c).
%
The corresponding charge values for $V_1/t = 0.8, V_2/t = 3.2 $ are given by $\varrho=0.364$ and $\Delta = 0.092$.
%
Moreover, we find a clear sublattice imbalance that grows as $V_{2}$ is increased that justifies the label CMs rather than the simpler CM.
%
We note also that the bond ordering of this phase is associated to the charge order: two neighboring sites with similar high (or low) charge densities
that deviate from half-filling suppress the hopping between them due to the large (small) number of filled (empty) states at that site. 
\\
% 
We have also accounted for the existence of the CMs state from a strong coupling perturbation theory analysis. 
%
By exactly diagonalizing the interaction part of $H$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:H} and then finding the first order hopping corrections $t/V_{1,2}$ in perturbation theory, 
we determined the ground state $\left.|GS\right>$ of a $3\times3$ cluster. 
%
We then computed different scalar correlation functions of the charge order parameters, and found that only $\left<GS|B_2 {\rm Re}[(G_1')^3-3G_1'(G_2')^2]|GS\right>$ is finite. 
%
This confirms that in the strong coupling limit, the ground state is indeed of the CMs form. The details of the procedure are presented in appendix \ref{sec:appendix}. 
%

\subsection{Kekul\'{e} bond order}
%
The next phase we identify is the Kekul\'{e}
bond order.
%
Like the CMs, it has a six site unit cell depicted schematically in Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(d)
with uniform charge order and two types of bonds, strong and weak.
%
Under the mean field approximation the state arises between the CMs and the CDW I state.
%
Although in previous exact diagonalization hints of this state are also observed,
the evidence supporting its occurrence is not entirely conclusive~\cite{GGNVC13} and
its tripled unit cell turns the analysis of larger clusters challenging.
%

Within iDMRG we find that this state is stable in a finite but smaller region compared to both 
exact diagonalization and mean field.
%
We show a representative of the state's numerically obtained charge and bond order patterns in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram} (b) 
calculated with Eqs.~\eqref{eq:charge} and \eqref{eq:bond}, respectively.
%
The bond thickness is proportional to its strength.
%
From Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}(b) it is apparent that the state has indeed two bond strengths arranged as in Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(d) 
and no charge order.
%
Therefore the system chooses to break the original two site unit cell translational symmetry 
falling into one of the three distinct Kekul\'{e} ground states~\cite{WF10}. 
%
At $V_{1}/t=5.6$ and $V_{2}/t=1.6$ the two types bonds are found numerically to be 
$t_{1}=0.522$ and $t_{2}=0.428$.

\subsection{Charge density wave II (CDW II)}
%
All phases that we have described so far do not differ
from those predicted by mean field~\cite{RQHZ08,WF10,PR12,GCC13} 
and the first exact diagonalization studies~\cite{GGNVC13,DH14,DCH14}.
%
At finite $V_{1}$ and sufficiently large $V_{2}$ we observe
a different charge order state (CDW II), see Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}.\\
%
To gain a first insight on this phase before analyzing the numerical data it is instructive to discuss its classical limit.
%
A strong coupling analysis (see appendix \ref{sec:appendix} for details) reveals quite generically 
that at $t=0$ there are two classical regimes separated by the $V_{1}=4V_{2}$ line. 
%
For $V_{1}>4V_{2}$ the state CDW~I is favoured with the same charge pattern as in Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(b) but classical occupations 0 or 1.
%
At $V_{1}=4V_{2}$ there exists a classically degenerate ground state manifold, to be discussed in the next section in the context of the CDW~III phase.
%
The analysis for $V_{1}<4V_{2}$ with $t=0$ reveals that there are essentially two types of degenerate states according to their translational symmetry.
%
First a stripe-like phase with a four atom unit cell~\noteAG{~Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(?)} \footnote{We thank A. Lauchli for important insights on the stripe-like.} that is six fold
degenerate in the thermodynamic limit.
%
Second, a set of states that can be understood by enriching the stripe-like phase with lines of hexagons rotated $60^{\circ}$ which form defect lines that wrap
around the chosen cluster.
%
The energy per site of these two types of states does not have first order hopping corrections and it is given by
$E_{\mathrm{CDW~II}} = V_2/2+V_1/4 + \mathcal{O}(t^2/V_{1,2})$ (see appendix \ref{sec:appendix} for details). 
%
The first nontrivial order in perturbation theory depends on the chosen cluster; eventually 
the degeneracy between the six-fold degenerate stripe-like phase and the phase with defects will be lifted, 
making one of them more favourable at finite $t$~\noteAG{Here we can cite Andreas~\cite{Andreas}}.
%
The question then becomes which type of ground state does the system choose in the thermodynamic limit.\\
%

Although we cannot attempt to fully answer this question some light can be shed through our iDMRG numerical data. 
%
We indeed find that both configurations, with and without defects are ground states with very similar energy,
even close to the transition to the semimetal phase.
%
A sample of one of this charge ordered patterns is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}(c) for $V_{1}/t=5.6$ and $V_{2}/t=3.2$.
%
This state has one defect lines that wrap twice around the cluster (indicated by dashed lines); rotating the hexagons along these
lines by $60^{\circ}$ in an anticlockwise direction we recover the more symmetric stripe-like configuration in ~\noteAG{~Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(?)}.
%
As with the CMs state, we find that its bond order follows directly from its charge order, suppressed for neighboring sites that have
equal filling.\\
%
By initializing the algorithm with each inequivalent classical ground state configuration it is possible to calculate to high precision each 
energy to then find by comparison the lowest energy state at that particular $\left\lbrace V_{1},V_{2}\right\rbrace$.
%
At $V_{1}=$ $V_{2}=$ for instance the lowest energy is achieved by a superposition of two classical ground states.



%
%At high $V_{2}$ but with sufficiently large $V_{1}$ we observe that
%a twelve site unit cell charge order (CDW II) depicted schematically in 
%Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(e) emerges.
%%
%A sample of its charge and bond order, as obtained with iDMRG via \eqref{eq:charge} and \eqref{eq:bond} is
%shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}(c).
%%
%It presents two distinct charge occupations as schematically shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(e).
%%
%For $V_{1}/t=5.6$ and $V_{2}/t=3.2$ they
%take the values $\varrho_{\pm}=1/2\pm\varrho$ with $\varrho=0.438$.
%%
%As with the CMs state, we find that its bond order follows directly from its charge order, suppressed for neighboring sites that have
%equal filling.\\
%%

%
%Remarkably, the CDW II state is connected to a classical strong coupling phase.
%%
%A strong coupling analysis performed in a twelve site cluster with the shape of the CDW~II 
%unit cell reveals a set of eight classical states with the same charge pattern but classical occupations 0 or 1. 
%%
%The energy per site of these states does not have first order hopping corrections,
%$E_{\mathrm{CDW~II}} = V_2/2+V_1/4 + \mathcal{O}(t^2/V_{1,2})$ (see appendix \ref{sec:appendix} for details). 
%%
%As long as the cluster geometry allows for this charge pattern, it must be present at sufficiently high $V_{1,2}$.
%%
%In fact, the energy of this classical state is always lower than that of the classical CMs states, 
%and it is only for low $V_1/t$ that the quantum corrections make the CMs state favored. 
%

\subsection{Charge density wave III (CDW III)}
%
At high $V_{1}$ and between the previously discussed CDW II and CDW I states
we find a third type of charge order with a twelve site unit cell labeled CDW III.
%
A representative pattern of its charge and bond order as obtained numerically 
with \eqref{eq:charge} and \eqref{eq:bond} respectively
is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}(d).
%
As schematically represented in Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(f), this state has three 
different occupations: half-filling and $1/2\pm\varrho$.
%
For the particular case of $V_{1}/t=9.2$ and $V_{2}/t=2.5$ we find that $\varrho=0.223$.
%
Its bond order is determined by the charge occupations 
as occurs with the CMs and CDW II phases.
%
As with the CDW II phase, this phase escaped
identification in the original mean field~\cite{RQHZ08,WF10,GCC13} 
and the first subsequent exact diagonalization~\cite{GGNVC13,DH14,DCH14} studies 
due to its large unit cell.\\
%
 \noteAG{Semiclassics:} 
 The emergence of the CDW III can also be understood from a semiclassics point of view.
 %
 At strong coupling analysis reveals that at $V_{1}=4V_{2}$ the classical ground state manifold is largely degenerate
 (see appendix A).
 %
 This line is special, it separates the classical CDW I ground state from the part of the phase diagram
 where the CDW II is more stable. 
 %
 Unlike for the CDW II, first order perturbation theory $t/V_{1,2}$ is able to lift this degeneracy
 and stabilise a charge ordered phase around a region $V_{1}\sim4V_{2}$.

\section{\label{sec:phasetransitions} Phase transitions}
%
\begin{figure}
 \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{{pdf/plot_cut_V2_0}.pdf}
 \caption{Correlation length at $V_2=0$, labeled cut A in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram} probing the transition between 
 the semimetal and CDW I phases. 
 %
 The smooth behavior of $\xi$ indicates a second order transition. 
 %
 The dashed grey line at $V_1/t = 1.356$ shows where the transition has been detected in quantum Monte Carlo simulations~\cite{WCT14}. \label{fig:cut_V2_0} }
\end{figure}
%
In order to unravel the character of the corresponding phase transitions we now study two quantities that are sensitive
to a phase change, the entanglement entropy $S$ and the correlation length $\xi$.
%
The entanglement entropy is defined by
%
\begin{equation}
 S = -\mathrm{Tr} \rho_L \log \rho_L,
\end{equation}
%
where $\rho_L = \mathrm{Tr}_R \ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}$ is the reduced density matrix of the left semi-infinite half $L$ of the cylinder after tracing out the right half $R$.
%
The correlation length $\xi$ can be computed from the resulting state of the iDMRG calculation according to Ref.~\cite{KZM13}.
%
Both quantities are expected to show a finite jump when crossing a first order transition while the correlation length diverges with increasing bond dimension at a second order critical point \cite{KZM13}.
%
In what follows, we focus on the lines labelled by cuts A--E in the phase diagram in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}.
%

\subsection{Cut A: semimetal--CDW I}

The first horizontal cut, labeled A addresses the character of the phase transition between the semimetallic
phase and the simplest charge density wave (CDW I) by fixing $V_{2}=0$.
%
This phase transition has been previously addressed with the quantum Monte-Carlo method~\cite{WCT14} 
and was determined to be of second order character.
%
The transition point with divergent correlation length was determined to be at $V_{1}/t = 1.356$ via finite size scaling.
%
In Fig.~\ref{fig:cut_V2_0} we show the correlation length as a function of $V_{1}$ 
for different values of the bond dimension $\chi$.

% 
%
Firstly, for $V_{1} \lesssim 1.5t$ we observe that the correlation length drops as a function of $V_{1}$
and diverges as the bond dimension $\chi$ is increased.
%
This behaviour is expected for a critical state such as the semimetal phase;  
the logarithmic divergence of entanglement of a metallic state requires an 
matrix product state with $\chi\to\infty$.
%
For $V_{1} \gtrsim 1.5t$ the correlation length continues to drop but has no longer a significant 
dependence on $\chi$.
%
This is characteristic of a gapped phase such as the charge density wave.
%
The crossover is smooth, signaling a second order phase transition, in agreement with 
quantum Monte Carlo studies \cite{WCT14}.
%
With iDMRG it is however not possible to pin point the exact value of $V_{1}$ 
where the transition happens via finite size scaling due to the few cylinder sizes 
we have available, as discussed in section \ref{sec:modandmeth}.
%
However, from Fig.~\ref{fig:cut_V2_0} it is possible to define a crossover region of $1.3 \lesssim V_{1}\lesssim 1.5$, 
consistent with the quantum Monte Carlo data \cite{WCT14}, where the transition occurs.


\subsection{Cut B: CMs--CDW II}

In cut B we fix $V_{2}=3.6t$ and study the phase transition between
the CMs and the CDW II phases.
%
The entanglement entropy is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cut_V2_3.6} 
as a function of $V_{1}$.
\begin{figure}
 \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{{pdf/plot_cut_V2_3.6}.pdf}
 \caption{Entanglement entropy at $V_2/t=3.6$, labeled cut B in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}. The finite jump of $S$ at $V_{2}/t\approx 2.2$ clearly signals a first oder transition between the CMs and CDW II phases. \label{fig:cut_V2_3.6}}
\end{figure}
% 
This quantity shows a clear jump at $V_{2}/t\approx 2.2$ signaling a direct first order
phase transition between these two phases.
%
We observe the same behavior when looking at the correlation length not presented here.
%
Additionally, the energy of the ground state as a function of $V_2$ shows a kink at the same critical $V_2$ which further supports the presence of a level crossing at that point.
%
As expected for gapped phases, the entanglement entropy only depends very weakly on the bond dimension, in the CDW II phase even a very low $\chi$ of 400 is sufficient to faithfully represent the state.
%

A first order phase transition is also expected from the strong coupling approach.
%
As detailed in appendix \ref{sec:appendix}, the energy per site of the CM phase in a $3\times3$ cluster is 
$E_{\text{CMs}} = V_2/2+V_1/3-0.248t$ for $V_1/V_2<3/2$, while the energy per site of the CDW II phase is $E_{\text{CDW~II}} = V_2/2+V_1/4$.
%
At $t=0$, $V_1=0$ both states have the same energy.
%
At finite $t$, the CM phase has lower energy due to the first order quantum correction, which is absent for CDW II. 
%
Since $E_{\text{CMs}}$ grows faster with $V_1$ than $E_{\text{CDW II}}$, there must be a crossing at a critical value
of the interaction signaling a first order phase transition into the CDW II state.


\subsection{Cut C: Semimetal--CMs}
%
The cut at $V_{1}/t=0.4$, labeled cut C in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}, 
probes the transition between the semimetal phase and the CMs phase.
%
In Fig.~\ref{fig:cut_V1_0.4} we present the entanglement entropy $S$ as a function of $V_{2}$, the interaction that drives the phase transition.

\begin{figure}
 \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{{pdf/plot_cut_V1_0.4}.pdf}
 \caption{Entanglement entropy at $V_1/t=0.4$, labeled cut C in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}, probing the phase transition between the semimetal and CMs phases. 
 %
 Going towards the phase boundary from high $V_2$, the entanglement entropy smoothly approaches the value in the semimetal indicating a second order transition. \label{fig:cut_V1_0.4}}
\end{figure}
%
As explained in Sec.~\ref{subsec:SM}, the entanglement entropy of 
the semimetal phase depends strongly on the bond dimension $\chi$.
%
At $V_{2}/t\approx 2.3 $ we observe a sharp transition
to a decaying entanglement entropy that does not depend strongly on $\chi$
as $V_{2}$ is increased.
%
However, the change in entanglement entropy is not as abrupt as in the CMs--CDW II case of the previous subsection as would be expected from a level crossing in a first order transition.
%
We can see a kink in $S$, but for decreasing $V_2$ it smoothly approaches the value of the semimetal phase.
%
In addition, the energy is a smooth function $V_2$ which together with the previously mentioned behaviour of $S$ strongly suggests that the transition is of second order.
%
The correlation length not depicted here shows a similar smooth behavior as in the transition between 
the semimetal and CDW I phases in Fig.~\ref{fig:cut_V2_0} which provides further evidence in favor of a second order transition.



\subsection{Cut D: CDW I--Kekul\'{e}--Semimetal--CDW II}

The next cut we focus on is labeled cut D in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram} at $V_1/t = 6$. The correlation length as a function of $V_2$ is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cut_V1_6}.
%
\begin{figure}
 \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{{pdf/plot_cut_V1_6}.pdf}
 \caption{Correlation length at $V_1/t=6$, labeled cut D in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}. 
 %
 In this plot, several phase boundaries are made visible. 
 %
 The transitions from CDW I to the Kekul\'e phase and from semimetal to CDW II present diverging 
 correlation lengths as the bond dimension is increased signaling a second order phase transition. \label{fig:cut_V1_6}}
\end{figure}
%
Starting from low $V_2$ we first cross the phase boundary between the charge density wave CDW I and the bond-ordered Kekul\'e phase.
%
As expected for a gapped phase, the correlation length deep in the CDW I phase depends only weakly on the bond dimension.
%
As we approach the phase transition, this behaviour changes since the many body gap is closing.
%
The strongly increasing correlation length which peaks at $V_2/t \approx 1.5$ suggests a second order transition between the CDW I and Kekul\'e phase.
%
Moreover, we can see the presence of a remnant charge order on top of the bond modulation in the Kekul\'e phase close to the critical point.
%
This signals a slow onset of charge ordering as a finite size effect as we approach the phase boundary from the Kekul\'e side which would be in contradiction to a level crossing for which the charge order should change suddenly.
%
In the Kekul\'e phase, the correlation length scales with $\chi$ even in the center of the phase.
%
This can be attributed to the fact that it is not a strong coupling phase in which the gap is determined by the interaction but rather by the hopping energy scale.

As $V_{2}$ is increased we cross the boundary between the Kekul\'e and the semimetal phase at $V_2/t \approx 1.9$.
%
From the data presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:cut_V1_6} it is not possible to reach a conclusion about the nature of the transition.
%
However, from the Landau theory perspective the semimetal--Kekul\'e transition has to be first order for the following reason.
%
The Kekul\'e bond order is in the twofold representation $E_1' = (E_{11}',E_{12}')$ \cite{Basko08} and the lowest order non-trivial term in the Landau free energy is the scalar $(E_{11}')^3-3E_{12}'(E_{11}')^2$ which is of third order, therefore signaling a first order transition. 
%
A first order transition is also consistent with the entanglement entropy which displays a small jump when crossing the phase boundary.
%

In the semimetal phase, we observe an astonishingly small correlation length for a critical state.
%
As explained in Sec.~\ref{subsec:SM} the hopping strengths around and along the cylinder are strongly renormalized.
% 
This shifts the Dirac nodes away form the $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{K'}$ points thus leading to an effectively gapped state for a finite cylinder circumference
with small correlation length.
%

Finally, at $V_2/t \approx 2.4$ the semimetal turns into the CDW II.
%
The clearly diverging correlation length on the CDW II side of the transition strongly points toward a second order phase transition.
%
Moreover, the strong dependence of $\xi$ on the bond dimension suggests that the ground state is becoming critical as we approach the critical point, especially compared to the behaviour of $\xi$ deep in the CDW II phase.


\subsection{Cut E: CDW I--Kekul\'e--CDW III--CDW II}
%
The last cut we address is labeled cut E in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram} and fixes $V_1/t = 9.2$. 
%
The entanglement entropy is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:cut_V1_9.2}. 
%
\begin{figure}
 \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{{pdf/plot_cut_V1_9.2}.pdf}
 \caption{Entanglement entropy at $V_1/t=9.2$, labeled cut E in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}. 
 %
 The smooth behavior of $S$ at the phase boundary between CDW I and Kekul\'e phase indicates a second order transition in accordance with the data of the correlation length in 
 Fig.~\ref{fig:cut_V1_6}. 
 %
 At $V_2/t \approx 2.8$, the entanglement entropy jumps which clearly indicates a first order transition between the CDW III and CDW II phases. 
  \label{fig:cut_V1_9.2}}
\end{figure}
%
With increasing $V_2$ we cross the second order phase transition from the CDW I to the Kekul\'e phase at $V_2/t \approx 2.2$ discussed above.
%
The entanglement data shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cut_V1_9.2} supports this statement since $S$ smoothly increases in the CDW I phase as we approach the phase boundary.
%

At $V_2/t \approx 2.4$ the system undergoes the transition to the CDW III phase.
%
Unfortunately, a conclusive statement about the order of the critical point cannot be drawn from the present data; especially since the entanglement entropy in the CDW III phase still shows a significant dependence on the bond dimension.
%

The last phase boundary in this cut lies between the CDW III and CDW II phases at $V_2/t \approx 2.8$.
%
Here, we can see a clear jump of the entanglement entropy, similar to that in cut~B (Fig.~\ref{fig:cut_V2_3.6}).
%
Moreover, we see a kink in the energy when crossing the phase boundary.
%
Together these features indicate a first order phase transition.



\section{\label{sec:discconc}Discussion and Conclusions}
%

The spontaneous emergence of the Haldane Chern insulator phase~\cite{H88} due to interactions in the half-filled spineless honeycomb lattice
model has been questioned by different methods since its proposal~\cite{RQHZ08,WF10,GCC13,GGNVC13,DH14,DCH14}.
%
In this work we have gone beyond previous mean field and exact diagonalization by using the iDMRG method, an algorithm that allows for quantum fluctuations
to play a role but minimizes the finite size effects due its intrinsic infinite cylinder geometry.
%

One of our main results is the absence of the Haldane Chern insulator state in this model.
%
It seems therefore that quantum fluctuations indeed jeopardize its emergence and work against
the naive mean field expectations.
%
Although there is no reason to believe that the situation is different for the $\pi-$flux model, which also hosts a
mean field Chern insulating phase that is absent in exact diagonalization~\cite{WF10,JGC13}, 
there is more hope for other frustrated models.
%
In particular, the interacting kagome lattice hosts a Chern insulator state within mean field theory when the filling is tuned to
the quadratic band point touching between the flat band and one of the two dispersive bands~\cite{WRW10}.
%
Its presence is predicted within the renormalization group approach~\cite{SF08,SYF09} which guarantees
its robustness at sufficiently low interaction strength.\\
%
In addition, we have theoretically predicted two novel competing phases, the CDW II and CDW III.
%
These states are topologically trivial charge ordered states that have a twelve site unit cell.
%
Such a large unit cell turns their identification within exact diagonalization or mean field studies 
challenging and highlights the advantages of the iDMRG method.
%
On the one hand the CDW II phase stems from a degenerate strong coupling phase that has no first order correction in powers of $t/V_{1,2}$.
%
To determine its exact charge order \noteAG{To be completed...} 
%
The CDW III on the other hand, occurs in a finite region around the classical transition between
the CDW I and II states $V_{1}=4V_{2}$.
%
In this region, the first order corrections $t/V_{1,2}$ lift the classical degeneracy and stabilize CDW III state. 
%
Both phases present as well a distinctive bond ordering that can be understood from their charge order.

From the evidence presented in this work we have established that CMs state occurs from first
order perturbation theory in powers of $t/V_{2}$ of an otherwise classically degenerate ground state.
%
This part of our work establishes the existence and robustness 
of this single particle charge order beyond numerical approximations.
%
Our semiclassical analysis, corroborated by the iDMRG numerical evidence,
provides an explanation of why this phase has a many-body gap of the order of the hopping strength $t/V_{2}$,
as was previously noticed~\cite{DH14,DCH14}, rather than determined by $V_{2}$ .
%
Both the semiclassical treatment and the numerical data we obtain establish that the CMs state
has a finite sublattice imbalance, a feature that was still under dispute~\cite{GCC13,DH14}.
%
Moreover, we have reported a characteristic bond order not addressed in previous studies.
%
As in the CDW II and CDW III cases such bond order is determined by the CMs charge order pattern.
%
Our results show that the CMs is stable for small $V_{1}$ and finite $t$.
% 
Increasing the former or reducing the latter leads to the CDW II classical ground state through a first order phase transition.\\
%
Furthermore, we have established the existence of the Kekul\'{e} bond order which occurs in a region of the phase 
diagram that appears to be smaller than that predicted by mean field and exact diagonalization.\\
%
Finally, we have used that the iDMRG method treats an infinite system as opposed to a finite cluster to analyse 
the different phase transitions using in particular the entanglement entropy $S$ and correlation length $\xi$.
%
The conclusions drawn from analyzing these quantities have sometimes to be complemented by the continuous 
or discontinuous dependence of the ground state energy on the $\left\lbrace V_{1},V_{2}\right\rbrace$ interactions.\\
%

To conclude we have established the phase diagram of spinless fermions hopping on the half-filled honeycomb lattice
with nearest and next to nearest hopping interactions and characterized the phase transitions among the different phases with iDMRG.
%
Our results provide solid evidence that Chern insulating phases are far more elusive than previously thought and
so alternative routes are necessary to drive these kind of topological states from strong electronic correlations in general.

\appendix

\section{\label{sec:appendix} Strong coupling perturbation theory}

In this Appendix we discuss the exact diagonalization method to determine the ground state in the strong coupling limit $t \ll V_{1,2}$. 
%
Consider splitting the Hamiltonian in Eq. \eqref{eq:H} into $H =H_V + H_t$ with
\begin{align}
%
 H_t &=-t\sum_{\left\langle i,j\right\rangle}(c^{\dagger}_{i}c^{\vphantom{\dagger}}_{j}+ \mathrm{h.c.}) \\
 %
H_V &= V_{1}\sum_{\left\langle i,j\right\rangle }n_{i}n_{j}+
%
V_{2}\sum_{\left\langle \left\langle i,j\right\rangle \right\rangle }n_{i}n_{j}. 
%
\label{eq:Hsplit}
\end{align}
%
In the strong coupling limit, we can obtain the ground state of $H$ by diagonalizing $H_V$ first and considering $H_t$ as a perturbation. 
%
The eigenstates of $H_V$
\begin{equation}
H_V \psi_{n,m} = E_n \psi_{n,m},
\end{equation}
where $m$ accounts for degeneracies, are simple to compute because charge is conserved at every site in the absence of hopping. 
%
$H_V$ is thus already diagonal in the occupation basis, i.e.
\begin{equation}
\left| \psi^{n,m}\right> = \prod_{C^{n,m}_i = 1} c^\dagger_i \left|0\right>,
\end{equation}
%
 with $C^{n,m}_i=0,1$ the occupation coefficients for the $n,m$ eigenstate. 
 %
The classical ground state manifold is spanned by $\left|\psi^{0,m}\right>$, with $m=1,\dots,M$.   

For small $t/V_{1,2}$, we can disregard the classical states with $n>0$, and project the $H_t$ Hamiltonian into the classical ground state manifold. 
%
Dropping the label $n=0$ from now on
%
\begin{equation}
(\tilde{H}_t)_{m_1m_2} =  \left< \psi^{m_1} \right| H_t \left| \psi^{m_2} \right>.
\end{equation}
%
We can now diagonalize $\tilde{H}_t$ and select the eigenstates of lowest energy $\epsilon_0$
%
\begin{equation}
\tilde{H}_t v_\alpha = \epsilon_0 v_\alpha,
\end{equation}
%
where $\alpha = 1,\ldots,D$ and $D$ is the true ground state degeneracy. The final ground state of $H$ is spanned by
%
\begin{equation}
\left| GS\right>_\alpha = \sum_{m=1}^M v^m_\alpha \left| \psi^m\right>.
\end{equation}
%
Obtaining the coefficients $v^m_\alpha$ is relatively simple because the effective size of the Hilbert space $M$ is much smaller than the full size of the Hilbert space of $H$.\\
%
We have used this method to diagonalize two clusters: a cluster with the shape of the unit cell of the CDW II phase (12 sites, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}(c)), and a cluster of $3\times3$ unit cells or 18 sites, i.e. the $L_y=6$ version of the cluster in Fig.~\ref{fig:Defs}. 
%
The results for the spectra can be summarized as follows. \\

In the case of the CDW II cluster, we find only two possible classical ground states with degeneracies 8 and 2.
% 
The projection of $H_t$ in these subspaces is zero for both cases, which means that both are stable strong coupling phases.
%
The first can be identified with the classical version of the CDW II state, where the two values of the occupancies are 0 or 1.
%
The 8 states correspond to the 8 equivalent ways to ensemble the CDW II pattern in the given unit cell. 
%
The second is the CDW I state, where the two states have a single sublattice (A or B) fully occupied. The energy per site of these states is given by
%
\begin{align}
E_{\mathrm{CDW~II}} &= \frac{1}{2}V_2 + \frac{1}{4}V_1 & & \tfrac{V_1}{V_2} < 4 \\
E_{\mathrm{CDW~I}} &= \frac{3V_2}{2}   & & 4 < \tfrac{V_1}{V_2}
\end{align}
%
In the case of the $3\times3$ cluster, at $t=0$ we find four possible classical ground states as a function of increasing $V_1$, with degeneracies 234, 108, 36, 2.
%
The projection of $H_t$ into these classical ground states is finite only for the first two, and the pattern of degeneracies at low energies becomes $(4,10,4,\ldots)$ for both.
%
This low energy pattern is the same as the one that is obtained for the CMs phase in exact diagonalization \cite{GGNVC13}, 
pointing to the fact that these two states represent the CMs phase (further evidence to support this claim is also shown below.).  
%
The third state is an intermediate classical state, and the fourth is again the CDW~I. 
%
The energies per site of the three phases in the $3\times3$ cluster are given by
%
\begin{eqnarray}
E_{\mathrm{CMs}} &=& \left\{ \begin{array}{c} \frac{V_2}{2} + \frac{V_1}{3} -0.248t \hspace{8mm} \tfrac{V_1}{V_2} < \tfrac{3}{2} \\

\end{eqnarray}
%
As explained in the main text, the energy per site of the CDW II phase $E_{\mathrm{CDW~II}}$ is lower than the classical energies of any state of the $3\times3$ cluster. 
%
Since the intermediate state does not have quantum corrections, its energy satisfies $E_{\mathrm{int}}>E_{\mathrm{CDW~II}}$ and it is never realized. 
%
The CMs state, however, has $E_{\mathrm{CMs}} < E_{\mathrm{CDW~II}}$ for small enough $V_1$ once the quantum corrections are included. 
%
In the two clusters studied with perturbation theory, only the state we have labeled as the CMs state is non trivial in the sense that it has first order quantum corrections.\\
%
We now show that this state is in fact the CMs state. 
%
To do so, we recall that in finite size exact diagonalization there is no spontaneous symmetry breaking, because all states related by symmetry are degenerate and will be present in the ground state manifold.
%
Therefore, to detect an ordered phase we resort to computing correlation functions evaluated in the ground state, from which order parameters can be obtained. 
%
 
Correlation functions for charge order parameters can be expressed in general as
%
\begin{equation}
\rho_{ij\ldots} = {\rm tr} \left< GS \right| c^\dagger_i c_ic^\dagger_j c_j \ldots \left| GS \right>, 
\end{equation}
%
which is given explicitly by
%
\begin{equation}
\rho_{ij\ldots} = \sum_{m,\alpha} (v_m^\alpha)^*v_m^\alpha C^m_i C^m_j \dots
\end{equation}
%
Fourier transforming the real space indices $ij\ldots$ and taking the combinations defined in the main text for the representations $B_2$ and $G$, we can compute any correlation function of order parameters $\left< GS \right| O_1 O_2 \ldots \left| GS \right> $ with $O = G, B_2$. 
%
The simplest scalars that signal the presence of charge order are simply the two point functions
\begin{align}
S_1 &= B_2^2, \\
S_2 &= |G_1|^2+|G_2|^2.
\end{align}
We have computed these correlation functions in the ground states of the $3\times3$ cluster with $V_1<3V_2$ and finite $t$ and found that they are both finite. 
%
However, this is not enough information to distinguish the CMs phase. 
%
In order to detect its particular order we have also computed the correlation functions of higher order for this ground state
%
\begin{align}
S_3 &= {\rm Im}(G_2^3-3G_2 G_1^2),  \\
S_4 &= B_2 {\rm Im}(G_1G_2), \\
S_5 &= [{\rm Im}(G_1G_2)]^2, \\
S_6 &= B_2{\rm Re}(G_1^3-3G_1 G_2^2),
\end{align}
%
and found that only $S_6$ is finite, therefore confirming the presence of the CMs phase with the strong coupling approach for $V_1<3V_2$.

%
The emergence of the Haldane Chern insulator state due to strong short range electron-electron interactions in the half-filled spinless honeycomb lattice
model has been proposed and challenged with different methods and yet it still remains controversial.
%
In this work we revisit the problem using the infinite density matrix renormalisation group method to go beyond previous mean field theory and exact
diagonalization studies.
%
We report numerical evidence supporting 
i) the absence of the Chern insulator state, 
ii) two previously unnoticed charge ordered phases, 
iii) the existence and stability of all the non-topological competing orders that were found previously within mean field and
iv) the character of the relevant phase transitions.
%
Our work establishes the phase diagram of the half-filled honeycomb lattice model tilting the balance
towards the absence of Chern insulator phase for this model.

\section{Introduction}
%
Topological phases of matter are remarkably robust states; their responses to external fields are
governed by topological invariants and thus many of their most important properties are insensitive to local perturbations~\cite{HK10,QZ11}.
%
Topologically protected responses result in intrinsically novel phenomena
including fractionalization of quantum numbers~\cite{Nayak2008} or transport governed by quantum anomalies~\cite{V03}
and can lead to diverse applications, ranging from fault tolerant quantum computation to spintronics~\cite{HK10,QZ11,Nayak2008}.
%
Added to the remarkable experimental discoveries of new topological phases in both two and three dimensions,
these ideas have boosted a sustained and voluminous scientific effort in the last decade that attempts to classify them 
and determine when and how can they emerge~\cite{S14}.\\
%
This work addresses a concrete question regarding emergence of topological phases that has so far remained controversial: 
the existence of the Chern insulator phase triggered by short-range electron-electron interactions in the
fermonic spinless half-filled honeycomb tight binding model.
%
The Chern insulator state, first identified by Haldane~\cite{H88} in the particular case of the honeycomb lattice, is a zero field analogue of the
integer quantum Hall effect; the Hall conductivity contribution of each band is quantised in integer units of $e^2/h$ and determined by a topological invariant, the Chern number.
%
Realising a Chern insulator in nature is not a trivial task~\cite{CZF13}; time-reversal must be broken with
the resulting magnetic flux averaging to zero over the unit cell, and hence over the entire sample.\\
%
In a remarkable proof of principle, a set of mean field studies~\cite{RQHZ08,WF10,GCC13} 
discussed how the Chern insulator can emerge from electron-electron interactions. 
%
It was shown that spinless electrons hoping in the half-filled honeycomb lattice with nearest and next-to-nearest neighbour interactions, $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ respectively 
[see Fig.~\ref{fig:Defs}], displayed a Chern insulator phase as described by Haldane~\cite{H88}.
%
The non-interacting realization of this Chern insulator phase has complex next to nearest neighbour hopings [see Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(g)].
%
Therefore within the mean field paradigm it can only occur in the region where $V_{2}>V_{1}$ such that $V_{2}$ spontaneously breaks time
reversal symmetry generating complex second nearest hopping strengths.
%
The latter condition 
was shown not to be a generic requirement; Chern insulator phases can be realized 
in mean field with only $V_{1}$ at the expense of enlarging the unit cell and doping the system~\cite{CGV11,GCC13}.
%
In addition, analogous topological phases have been obtained in other lattices such as the $\pi-$flux model~\cite{WF10,JGC13}.

The important question that still remains to be answered is wether the interaction induced Chern state survives 
after the effect of quantum fluctuations is included.
%
The Haldane Chern insulator phase competes with more conventional but also interesting orders, 
that can jeopardise its emergence and are depicted schematically in Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}.
%
On the one hand, in the $V_{1} \gg V_{2}$ limit, a charge ordered state depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(b) is expected, 
where the A and B sub-lattices are populated differently~\cite{RQHZ08,WCT14}.
%
Being connected to the classical ground state at $V_{1}/t \to \infty$ with only one occupied sublattice, this state (CDW I) has been found to be very robust both in mean field an exact diagonalization~\cite{GGNVC13,DH14}.
%
For $V_{2}\gg V_{1}$ on the other hand it was shown under the mean field paradigm~\cite{GCC13} that the phase space originally attributed to the Haldane Chern insulator 
was severely reduced by the presence of a sub-lattice charge modulated state (or CMs) depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(c).
%
The CMs phase was corroborated to survive quantum fluctuations in exact diagonalization~\cite{GGNVC13,DCH14} and within a variational Monte Carlo approach~\cite{DCH14}.
%
However, its exact nature was questioned by Ref.~\cite{DH14} where it was argued that a pinball liquid state~\cite{HF06,MRF13} --a state where a fraction of electrons remains pinned to fixed lattice sites while the remaining fermions explore the unoccupied sites-- cannot be discarded. \noteFdJ{Does Daghofer really question the existence of CMs or just reinterprets it?}\noteAG{They are not very clear in their paper but let me check again.}
%
In addition, at intermediate $V_{1}\lesssim V_{2}$ a Kekul\'e bond order~\cite{C00,HCM07,WF10,RH10,RJH13} depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(d), that triples the original honeycomb two atom unit cell, 
was found to be stable within mean field theory.
%
Although numerical evidence consistent with such bond order was found in exact diagonalization~\cite{GGNVC13}, further insights are needed to corroborate its existence in the thermodynamic limit.
%
Finally, the Haldane Chern insulator phase of Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(g), stable within mean field, was found however to be absent in exact diagonalization with periodic boundary conditions~\cite{GGNVC13,DH14} and cluster perturbation theory~\cite{DH14} suggesting that quantum fluctuations indeed can destabilize its emergence.
%
Nonetheless, this interpretation was challenged by Ref.~\cite{DCH14} that observed hints of this phase with exact diagonalization with open boundary conditions and variational Monte Carlo.\\

 %
 Phases (a)-(d) and (g) were found within mean field theory by Refs.~\cite{RQHZ08,WF10,GCC13}.
 %
The survival of the Haldane Chern insulator phase (g) was challenged within exact diagonalization with periodic boundary conditions
by Refs.~\cite{GGNVC13,DH14} but found in Ref.~\cite{DCH14} for open boundary conditions.

 %
\end{figure}
%
The contradictory numerical evidence regarding the existence of the Chern insulator phase in particular, and other competing phases in general, needs of an alternative approach
that includes quantum fluctuations while minimizing finite size effects.
%
In this work we therefore revisit the controversies left unsolved by previous studies using the infinite density matrix renormalization group method (iDMRG)~\cite{M08,W92,KZM13}. 
%
This variational method determines the ground-state of systems of size $L_{x} \times L_{y}$ where $L_{x}$ is in the thermodynamic limit and $L_{y}$ goes beyond
what is achievable in exact diagonalization.
%
Traditionally a method for finding the ground state of one-dimensional systems, there has been recent 
important progress and reported success of iDMRG applied to two dimensional systems.
%
The infinite and finite DMRG method were indeed shown to be able to characterise the properties of fractional quantum Hall~\cite{ZMP13},
$\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid~\cite{HSC14}, chiral spin liquid \cite{HSC14b} and bosonic and fermionic fractional Chern insulating states~\cite{JWB12,CV13,ZKB13,GMZ15}.
%
As long as entanglement remains low and the state has short correlation lengths the ground-state
can be represented faithfully by a product of matrices, termed matrix product state (MPS), with matrices of a finite and computationally affordable
dimension $\chi$~\cite{M08,W92,KZM13}.
%
This requirement is commonly met by gapped systems and in particular by the orders argued above to be expected instabilities in the half-filled 
honeycomb lattice of interest here.
%
Moreover the iDMRG method deals with an infinite system and thus, unlike exact diagonalization, it can probe directly ground states that spontaneously break the original symmetries of the hamiltonian and the phase transitions among them, while allowing for quantum fluctuations to play a role. 
%
\\
 
%
Motivated by these advantages we have mapped the $\left\lbrace V_{1},V_{2}\right\rbrace$ phase diagram for the half-filled honeycomb lattice in the infinite cylinder geometry
with the iDMRG method.
%
Our main findings are summarised next.
%
First we show compelling numerical evidence that supports the absence of the Chern insulator state in a wide region of $\left\lbrace V_{1},V_{2}\right\rbrace$ phase space.
%
Second, we find two new phases not reported previously neither within mean field nor exact diagonalization results and give a semiclassical argument for one 
of these to occur.
%
Third, we provide numerical support for the existence and stability of all the competing orders that were found previously within mean field.
%
In particular we characterise the two more controversial states, the CMs and Kekul\'{e} states, by computing bond and charge expectation values
and present further arguments of the existence of the former from the semiclassical large interaction limit.
%
Fourth, we provide numerical evidence to asses the first or second order character of the relevant phase transitions.
%
Concretely we address this issue by identifying the features that the correlation length $\xi$ and the entanglement entropy $S$ present as a function of $\left\lbrace V_{1},V_{2}\right\rbrace$.\\

This work is structured as follows. 
%
After describing the method and model in section~\ref{sec:modandmeth} we
characterise the different phases that we find in section~\ref{sec:phasediagram}.
%
The corresponding phase transitions among them are analyzed in section~\ref{sec:phasetransitions}
and we end with a discussion and prospect of our results in section~\ref{sec:discconc}.


\section{\label{sec:modandmeth}Model and Method}
%
We investigate a system of spinless electrons hopping on a honeycomb lattice with real nearest neighbor hopping $t$ interacting via nearest and next to nearest neighbor interactions 
$\left\lbrace V_{1},V_{2}\right\rbrace$ respectively [see Fig.~\ref{fig:Defs}]. 
%
The Hamiltonian for this system can be written as
 %
\begin{equation}
%
 H:=-t\sum_{\left\langle i,j\right\rangle}(c^{\dagger}_{i}c^{\vphantom{\dagger}}_{j}+ \mathrm{h.c.})+
 %
V_{1}\sum_{\left\langle i,j\right\rangle }n_{i}n_{j}+
%
V_{2}\sum_{\left\langle \left\langle i,j\right\rangle \right\rangle }n_{i}n_{j}.
%
\label{eq:H}
\end{equation}
%
where $c_{i}^{\vphantom{\dagger}}$ $(c^{\dagger}_{i})$  annihilates (creates) an electron at the $i$-th site of the honeycomb lattice.\\
%
In order to find the ground state of the system in the $\left\lbrace V_{1},V_{2}\right\rbrace$ phase space
we employ the iDMRG algorithm~\cite{M08,W92,KZM13} on an infinite cylinder geometry [see Fig.~\ref{fig:Defs}].
%
As discussed above, such infinite geometry allows to probe ground states with spontaneous 
symmetry breaking while taking into account quantum fluctuations.
%
Feasible system sizes for our purposes are cylinders of circumference $L_{y} = 6,8,10$ and $12$.
%
For our calculations we choose $L_y=12$ and a unit cell of 36 sites depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:Defs}.
%
We pick this geometry for the following two reasons.
%
First, 
%
we have to keep in mind the structure of the reciprocal space.
%
Since we work in the thermodynamic limit in the $x$-direction along the cylinder, the momentum in $x$-direction is a continuous quantity.
%
However in the finite $y$-direction around the cylinder, the momentum is a discrete variable.
%
In the non-interacting case, the model forms a Dirac semimetal and the Fermi surface is located at the 
$\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{K}^{\prime}$ points~\cite{CastroNeto2009}.
%
In order to capture the low energy physics correctly, it is of key importance that $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{K}^{\prime}$ are allowed momenta in our unit cell which implies that only $L_y=6$ and $12$ are suitable circumferences of our cylinder.
%
Second, we have to make sure that all orders that result from our calculations are commensurate with the chosen unit cell.
%
We also performed some calculations for $L_y=6$ at which this problem was present for some of the phases.
%
Moreover, $L_y=12$ brings us the closest possible to the thermodynamic limit.
%
Considering this reasoning, the unit cell we have chosen represents the computationally least costly geometry that meets the above criteria.
%
The data we show in the remainder of the text is all computed for $L_y = 12$ and bond dimension $\chi = 1600$ unless otherwise stated.


\section{\label{sec:phasediagram}Phase diagram}
%
We have mapped the phase diagram as a function of $\left\lbrace V_{1},V_{2}\right\rbrace$ with the method described above.
%
Our main results are summarised in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}.
%
We find six different phases: two novel charge order phases labelled CDW II and CDW III and four previously 
reported mean field orders, the Kekul\'{e}, CMs, CDW I and semimetal phases.\\
%
In order to characterize each state we have computed the charge and bond ground state expectation values.
%
At each site the charge expectation value is defined by 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:charge}
n_{i}=\left\langle c^{\dagger}_{i}c_{i}\right\rangle.
\end{eqnarray}
%
The bond ground state expectation value on the other hand is defined as
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:bond}
t_{ij}=\left\langle c^{\dagger}_{i}c_{j}+\mathrm{h.c.}\right\rangle
\end{eqnarray}
%
%
Next we describe the corresponding charge and bond ordering patterns of each phase 
that characterises them within the iDMRG method.

\begin{figure*}
 \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{pdf/phase_diagram_ext.pdf}
 \caption{Left: Phase diagram obtained with iDMRG calculations on an infinte cylinder of circumference $L=12, \, \chi = 1600$. 
 %
 Right: Representative density and hopping amplitude patterns for the four most relevant phases discussed in the main text. 
 %
 The area of the blue circles is proportional to the particle number expectation value on the respective site given by Eq. \eqref{eq:charge}. 
 %
 The thickness of the ellipsoids on the bonds is proportional to the hopping amplitude $t_{ij}$ between nearest neighbours defined by Eq.~\eqref{eq:bond}.
 %
 The unit cells for each phase are depicted by the red polygons. 
 %
 These correspond to (a) charge modulated (CMs) phase with $V_1/t = 0.8, V_2/t = 3.2 $, (b) Kekul\'e phase with $V_1/t = 5.6, V_2/t = 1.6 $, (c) Charge density wave II (CDW II) with $V_1/t = 5.6, V_2/t = 3.2$,  (d) Charge density wave III (CDW III) with $V_1/t = 9.2, V_2/t = 2.5$. 
 %
 \label{fig:phase diagram}}
\end{figure*}


%

\subsection{Semimetal phase \label{subsec:SM}}
%
We start by discussing the semimetal phase in the phase diagram shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}.
%
At $V_{1}/t=V_{2}/t=0$ the honeycomb lattice with nearest neighbour hopping its 
known to be described by a low energy theory in terms of two massless Dirac fermions~\cite{CastroNeto2009}.
%
Short range interactions are irrelevant in the renormalisation group sense~\cite{S94,KUP12} 
and therefore they can only drive a transition to an ordered state when they have a magnitude comparable to the nearest neighbour hopping strength $t$.
%
Such perturbative analysis guarantees that the semimetal is stable within
the region $\left\lbrace V_{1},V_{2}\right\rbrace \lesssim t$, only allowing for a uniform renormalization 
of the hopping strength $t$ by interactions.\\

%
For the semimetal phase in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}, and to numerical accuracy, we find by computing the charge expectation value
\eqref{eq:charge} that $n_{i}=1/2$ for all sites indicating that this phase is not charge ordered.\\
%
From \eqref{eq:bond} and choosing $i,j$ to be nearest neighbours we find
a small asymmetry between bonds pointing along and around the cylinder axis,
characterized by $r\sim10^{-2}$, with $r$ the relative difference between these two types of bonds.
%
Such asymmetry should vanish in a perfect semimetallic phase and indeed it is severely reduced as the bond dimension $\chi$ is increased.
% 
This suggests that the cylinder geometry implemented in iDMRG artificially differentiates bonds in its two perpendicular directions.
%
The asymmetry vanishes as $\chi$ is increased and thus it is not a physical effect.
%
This is consistent with a semimetal state; the logarithmic divergence of entanglement of a metallic state requires a matrix product state with $\chi\to\infty$. 
%
The bond asymmetry reduces the entanglement by shifting the Dirac cones away from the $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{K'}$ points~\cite{ACJ15}.\\
%
%In addition, we find as well that the bond strength increases with interaction strength, as expected form the renormalisation group analysis. 
%
Together, the previous numerical evidence are consistent with the semimetallic state.
%
We note that numerically the semimetal state extends beyond $\left\lbrace V_{1},V_{2}\right\rbrace \lesssim t$ towards
higher interaction strengths through a narrow semimetal trench in the phase diagram.
%
The smaller size of this region at $L=6$ (not shown) suggest that it is likely to shrink as the circumference of the cylinder is increased but
a definitive statement requires going beyond the numerically accessible sizes. 
%

\subsection{Charge density wave I (CDW I)}
%
Upon increasing $V_{1}$ we identify a charge density wave state labelled CDW I in the phase diagram of Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}.
%
This state has a two site unit cell and is characterized by a finite order parameter
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:CDW}
%
M=\left\langle n_{A} \right\rangle-\left\langle n_{B}\right\rangle,
%
\end{equation}
%
that can be calculated using \eqref{eq:charge}, where $n_{A}$ and $n_{B}$ are the density of electrons in the $A$ and $B$ sub-lattice sites of the two site unit cell respectively. 
%
The resulting charge order transforms under the symmetry group $C_{6v}''$ as the $B_2$ representation and is depicted schematically in Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(b). 
%
For instance, at $V_{1}/t = 4$ and $V_{2}/t = 0.4$ we find that $M=$. \noteAG{Number needed}
%
Numerically the magnitude of $M$ increases with $V_{1}$ and to numerical accuracy this phase has no appreciable bond order.\\
%s
For large $V_{1}\gg t$ such a state is a natural instability since the energy is minimised by a charge imbalance between the two sub-lattices.
%
Indeed, it has been found in a mean field approximation~\cite{RQHZ08,WF10,GCC13}, exact diagonalization~\cite{GGNVC13,DH14,DCH14}, 
and quantum Monte Carlo simulations~\cite{WCT14}.
%


\subsection{Sub-lattice charge modulated phase (CMs)}
%
For small $t \ll V_{2}$ the ground state is classically degenerate. 
%
Within mean field it was shown that as long as $V_{2}>V_{1}$ the system chose a charge ordered pattern with charge modulation 
of wavevector $\mathbf{K}$ or $\mathbf{K}'$, termed the CMs phase~\cite{GCC13}. 
%
The order parameters for any such modulation can be taken as the corresponding Fourier components of the charge expectation values of Eq.~\eqref{eq:charge},
namely $\left\langle n_{A,B}(\mathbf{K}) \right\rangle = \left\langle n_{A,B}(\mathbf{K}') \right\rangle^*$, where A and B indicate the two sub-lattices.
%
It is convenient to arrange these order parameters in a basis that has well defined transformation properties under the symmetry of the lattice.
%
Under the action of the symmetry group $C_{6v}''$, these order parameters transform as the four dimensional $G'$ representation 
\noteAG{Ref to a paper, maybe the non-abelian gauge fields? Also, might be worth to introduce with a sentence what is $B_2$.
Actually, we can unify it with \eqref{eq:CDW} since these are the same thing right?}
%
\begin{align}
G_{1x} = {\rm Re}[n_{A}(\mathbf{K}) -n_{B}(\mathbf{K})] \\
G_{1y} =  {\rm Im}[n_{A}(\mathbf{K}) -n_{B}(\mathbf{K})] \\
G_{2x} =  {\rm Im}[n_{A}(\mathbf{K}) +n_{B}(\mathbf{K})] \\
G_{2y} =  {\rm Re}[n_{A}(\mathbf{K}) +n_{B}(\mathbf{K})]
\end{align}
%
The CMs state corresponds to a finite expectation value of both the $B_2$ order parameter and $G = (1,0,0,0)$ and the states generated from these by operations of the symmetry group. A scalar order parameter for the CMs phase can be defined as $S_6 = B_2 {\rm Re}(G_1^3-3G_1G_2^2)$, where $G_i = G_{ix}+iG_{iy}$. 
%
Such order is schematically shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(c). It minimizes the large cost
attributed to $V_{2}$ by reversing two nearest neighbour dimers at the expense of paying the small energetic cost determined by $V_{1}$.
%
Within exact diagonalization it has been argued that the CMs state survives quantum fluctuations~\cite{GGNVC13,DH14,DCH14} 
but its single particle nature was challenged in Ref.~\onlinecite{DH14} suggesting that a pinball like state~\cite{HF06,MRF13} cannot be ruled out.\\
%
With the iDMRG method we find that the CMs appears directly above the semimetallic phase~[see Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}].
%
A sample of the six site unit cell charge and bond pattern obtained from \eqref{eq:charge} for $V_1/t = 0.8, V_2/t = 3.2 $ is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}(a).
%
The circles at each site have an area proportional to the strength of the charge at the given site, while the thickness of the links between the sites
represent the bond strengths.
%
Such pattern survives in the region labelled CMs of the phase diagram and coincides with that obtained within mean field theory~\cite{GCC13} 
depicted schematically in Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(c).
%
We note that the bond ordering of this phase is associated to the charge order: two neighbouring sites with similar high (or low) charge densities
that deviate from half-filling suppress the hopping between them due to the large (small) number of filled (empty) states at that site. \\
% 
We have also reproduced the existence of the CMs state from a strong coupling perturbation theory analysis. 
%
By exactly diagonalizing the interaction part of $H$ and then finding the first order hopping corrections in perturbation theory, 
we determined the ground state $\left.|GS\right>$ of a 3x3 cluster. 
%
We then computed different scalar correlation functions of the charge order parameters, and found that only $\left<GS|B_2 {\rm Re}(G_1^3-3G_1G_2^2)|GS\right>$ is finite. 
%
This confirms that in the strong coupling limit, the ground state is indeed of the CMs form. The details of the procedure are shown in appendix \ref{sec:appendix}. 
%

\subsection{Kekul\'{e} bond order}
%
The next phase we identify is the Kekul\'{e}
bond order.
%
Like the CMs, it has a six site unit cell depicted schematically in Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(d)
with uniform charge order and two types of bonds, strong and weak.
%
Under the mean field approximation the state arises between the CMs and the CDW I state.
%
Although in exact diagonalization hints of this state are also observed,
the evidence supporting its occurrence is not entirely conclusive~\cite{GGNVC13} and
its tripled unit cell turns the analysis of larger clusters challenging.
%

Within iDMRG we find that these state is stable in a smaller but finite region compared to both 
exact diagonalization and mean field.
%
We show a representative of the state's numerically obtained charge and bond order patterns in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram} (b) 
calculated with eqs. \eqref{eq:charge} and \eqref{eq:bond} respectively.
%
The bond thickness is proportional to its strength.
%
From Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram} (b) it is apparent that the state has indeed two bond strengths arranged as in Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(d) 
and no charge order.
%
Therefore the system chooses to break the $C_{6v}''$ symmetry down to a $C_{3}$
falling into one of the three distinct Kekul\'{e} ground states~\cite{WF10}.
%
At $V_{1}/t=5.6$ and $V_{2}/t=1.6$ the two types bonds are found numerically to be 
$t_{1}=$ and $t_{2}=$~\noteAG{number needed}.



\subsection{Charge density wave II (CDW II)}
%
All phases that we have described so far do not differ
from those predicted by mean field and exact diagonalization.
%
At high $V_{2}$ but with sufficiently large $V_{1}$ we observe that
a twelve site unit cell charge order (CDW II) depicted schematically in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(e) emerges.
%
A sample of its charge and bond order, as obtained with iDMRG via \eqref{eq:charge} and \eqref{eq:bond} is
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram} (c).
%
It presents two distinct charge occupations as schematically shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(e).
%
For $V_{1}/t=5.6$ and $V_{2}/t=3.2$ 
take the values $\varrho_{\pm}=1/2\pm\varrho$ with $\varrho=$~\noteAG{number needed}.
%
As with the CMs state, we find that its bond order follows directly from its charge order, suppressed for neighbouring sites that have
the occupation furthest away from half-filling.\\
%

%
Remarkably, the CDW II state is connected to a classical strong coupling phase.
%
A strong coupling analysis performed in 12 site cluster with the shape of the CDW II 
unit cell reveals a set of 8 classical states with the same charge pattern but classical occupations 0 or 1. 
%
The energy per site of these states does not have first order hopping corrections,
$E_{\mathrm{CDW II}} = V_2/2+V_1/4 + O(t^2)$, so the CDW II is a stable strong coupling phase 
(see appendix \ref{sec:appendix} for details). 
%
As long as the cluster allows for this charge pattern, it must be present at sufficiently high $V_{1,2}$.
%
In fact, the energy of this classical state is always lower than that of the classical CMs states, 
and it is only for low $V_1/t$ that the quantum corrections make the CMs state favored. 
%

\subsection{Charge density wave III (CDW III)}
%
At high $V_{1}$ and between the previously discussed CDW II and CDW I states
we find a third type of charge order labelled CDW III.
%
This phase has a 12 site unit cell but in this case it cannot be connected to a classical strong coupling state.
%
A representative patter of its charge and bond order as obtained numerically 
with \eqref{eq:charge} and \eqref{eq:bond} respectively
is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}(d).
%
As schematically represented in Fig.~\ref{fig:orders}(f), this state has three 
different occupations, half-filling and $1/2\pm\varrho$.
%
For the particular case $V_{1}/t=9.2$ and $V_{2}/t=2.5$ we find that $\rho=$~\noteAG{number needed}.
%
Its bond order is determined by the charge occupations 
as occurs with the CMs and CDW II phases.
%
As with the CDW II phase, this phase escaped
identification in the original mean field~\cite{RQHZ08,WF10,GCC13} 
and the first subsequent exact diagonalization~\cite{GGNVC13,DH14,DCH14} studies 
due to its large unit cell.
%
 




\section{\label{sec:phasetransitions} Phase transitons}
%
A crucial advantage of the iDMRG method is that, unlike finite
size methods such as exact diagonalization it can give information about the order of phase transitions.
%
In order to unravel their character we now study two quantities that are sensitive
to a phase change, the entanglement entropy $S$ and the correlation length $\xi$.
%
The entanglement entropy is defined by
%
\begin{equation}
 S = \mathrm{Tr} \rho_L \log \rho_L,
\end{equation}
%
where $\rho_L = \mathrm{Tr}_R \ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}$ is the reduced density matrix of the left semi-infinite half $L$ of the cylinder after tracing out the right half $R$.
%
The correlation length $\xi$ can be computed from the resulting state of the iDMRG calculation according to Ref.~\cite{KZM13}.
%
For the sake of capturing all relevant transitions in the parameter space of our investigation, we focus on the lines labelled by cuts A--E in the phase diagram in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}.
%
\noteFdJ{Perhaps it would be good to explain how to distinguish first from second order phase transitions in general before explaining the examples? As a non DMRG person this wasn't obvious to me.}

\subsection{Cut A: semimetal--CDW-I}

The first horizontal cut, labelled A addresses the character of the phase transition between the semi-metallic
phase and the simplest charge density wave (CDW I) by fixing $V_{2}=0$.
%
This phase transition has been previously addressed with the quantum Monte-Carlo method~\cite{WCT14} 
and was determined to be of second order character.
%
The transition point with divergent correlation length was determined to be at $V_{1}/t = 1.356$ via finite size scaling.
%
In Fig.~\ref{fig:cut_V2_0} we show the correlation length as a function of $V_{1}$ 
for different values of the bond dimension $\chi$.
\begin{figure}
 \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{{pdf/plot_cut_V2_0}.pdf}
 \caption{Correlation length at $V_2=0$, labelled cut A in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}. The dashed grey line at $V_1/t = 1.356$ shows where the transition has been detected in quantum Monte Carlo \cite{WCT14}. \label{fig:cut_V2_0} }
\end{figure}
% 
%
Firstly, for $V_{1} \lesssim 1.5t$ we observe that the correlation length diverges as the bond
dimension of the MPS is increased.
%
This behaviour is expected for a critical state such as the semimetal phase;  
the logarithmic divergence of entanglement of a metallic state requires an MPS with $\chi\to\infty$.
%
For $V_{1} \gtrsim 1.5t$ the correlation length drops significantly and has no longer a significant 
dependence on $\chi$.
%
This is characteristic of a gapped phase such as the charge density wave.
%
The crossover is smooth, signalling a second order phase transition, in agreement with 
quantum Monte Carlo studies \cite{WCT14}.
%
With iDMRG it is however not possible to pin point the exact value of $V_{1}$ 
where the transition happens via finite size scaling due to the few cylinder sizes 
we have available, as discussed in section \ref{sec:modandmeth}.
%
However, from Fig.~\ref{fig:cut_V2_0} it is possible to define a crossover region of $1.3 \lesssim V_{1}\lesssim 1.5$,

%\subsection{Cut B: semimetal--CMs}
%%
%The cut at $V_{1}=0.4t$, labelled cut B in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}, 
%probes the transition between the semimetal phase and the CMs phase.
%%
%In Fig.~\ref{fig:cut_V1_0.4} we present the entanglement entropy $S$ as a function of $V_{2}$, the interaction that drives the phase transition.

%As expected from the previous analysis the entanglement entropy of 
%the semimetal phase depends strongly on the MPS bond dimension $\chi$.
%%
%At $V_{2}/t\approx 2.3 $ we observe a sharp transition
%to a decaying entanglement entropy that does not depend strongly on $\chi$
%as $V_{2}$ is increased from the transtion.
%%
%However, the change in enganglement entropy is continuous and does not show a jump as would be expected from a level crossing in a first order transition.
%%
%This suggests that the transition from semimetal to the CMs phase is of second order.
%
%
%\subsection{Cut C: CMs--CDW II}
%=======
consistent with the quantum Monte Carlo data \cite{WCT14}, where the transition occurs.


\subsection{Cut B: CMs--CDW II}
%>>>>>>> 3a9846ccbba2d5ddce9dfd61a1e42044880bfa12

In cut C we fix $V_{2}=3.6t$ and study the phase transition between
the CMs and the CDW II phase.
%
The entanglement entropy is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cut_V2_3.6} 
as a function of $V_{1}$.
\begin{figure}
 \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{{pdf/plot_cut_V2_3.6}.pdf}
 \caption{Entanglement entropy at $V_2/t=3.6$, labelled cut B in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}. \label{fig:cut_V2_3.6}}
\end{figure}
% 
This quantity shows a clear jump at $V_{2}/t\approx 2.2$ signalling a direct first order
phase transition between these two phases.
%
We observe the same behaviour when looking at the correlation length not presented here.
%
Additionally, the energy of the ground state as a function of $V_2$ shows a kink at the same critical $V_2$ which further supports the presence of a level crossing at that point.
%
As expected for gapped phases, the entanglement entropy only depends very weakly on the bond dimension, in the CDW II phase even the low $\chi$ of 400 is sufficient to faithfully represent the state.
%

%<<<<<<< HEAD
%A first order phase transition is also expected from the strong coupling approach (see appendix~\ref{sec:appendix}). 
%%
%As described in section \ref{}, the energy per site of the CMs phase in a 3x3 cluster is $E_{\text{CMs}} = V_2/2+V_1/3$ for $V_1/V_2<3/2$, while the energy per site of the CDW II phase is $E_{\text{CDW II}} = V_2/2+V_1/4$. At $t=0$, $V_1=0$ both states have the same energy. 
%%
%At finite $t$, the CMs phase has lower energy due to the first order quantum correction, which is absent for CDW II. 
%%
%Since $E_{\text{CMs}}$ grows faster with $V_1$ than $E_{\text{CDW II}}$, there must be a crossing at a critical $V$ signalling a first order phase transition into the CDW II state. 
%=======
A first order phase transition is also expected from the strong coupling approach (see appendix~\ref{sec:appendix}).
%
As described in section \ref{sec:appendix}, the energy per site of the CM phase in a 3x3 cluster is $E_{\text{CMs}} = V_2/2+V_1/3$ for $V_1/V_2<3/2$, while the energy per site of the CDW II phase is $E_{\text{CDW II}} = V_2/2+V_1/4$.
%
At $t=0$, $V_1=0$ both states have the same energy.
%
At finite $t$, the CM phase has lower energy due to the first order quantum correction, which is absent for CDW II. 
%
Since $E_{\text{CMs}}$ grows faster with $V_1$ than $E_{\text{CDW II}}$, there must be a crossing at a critical $V$ signalling a first order phase transition into the CDW II state.


\subsection{Cut C: SM--CMs}
%
The cut at $V_{1}/t=0.4$, labelled cut B in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}, 
probes the transition between the semimetal phase and the CMs phase.
%
In Fig.~\ref{fig:cut_V1_0.4} we present the entanglement entropy $S$ as a function of $V_{2}$, the interaction that drives the phase transition.

\begin{figure}
 \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{{pdf/plot_cut_V1_0.4}.pdf}
 \caption{Entanglement entropy at $V_1/t=0.4$, labelled cut C in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}. \label{fig:cut_V1_0.4}}
\end{figure}
%
As explained in Sec.~\ref{subsec:SM}, the entanglement entropy of 
the semimetal phase depends strongly on the MPS bond dimension $\chi$.
%
At $V_{2}/t\approx 2.3 $ we observe a sharp transition
to a decaying entanglement entropy that does not depend strongly on $\chi$
as $V_{2}$ is increased.
%
However, the change in enganglement entropy is not as abrupt as in the CMs--CDW II case of the previous subsection as would be expected from a level crossing in a first order transition.
%
We can see a kink in $S$, but the points can be extrapolated into a continuous line indicated in Fig~\ref{fig:cut_V1_0.4}.
%
This suggests that the transition from semimetal to the CMs phase is of second order.
%
The correlation length not depicted here shows a similar smooth behaviour as in the transition between semimetal and CDW I phase in Fig.~\ref{fig:cut_V2_0} which further supports the claim of a second order transition.



\subsection{Cut D: CDW I--Kekul\'{e}--semimetal--CDW II}

The next cut we focus on is labelled cut D in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram} at $V_1/t = 6$. The correlation length as a function of $V_2$ is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cut_V1_6}.
%
\begin{figure}
 \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{{pdf/plot_cut_V1_6}.pdf}
 \caption{Correlation length at $V_1/t=6$, labelled cut D in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}. \label{fig:cut_V1_6}}
\end{figure}
%
Starting from low $V_2$ we first cross the phase boundary between the charge density wave CDW I and the bond-ordered Kekul\'e phase.
%
As expected for a gapped phase, the correlation length deep in the CDW I phase depends only weakly on the bond dimension.
%
As we approach the phase transition, this behaviour changes since the many body gap is closing.
%
The strongly increasing correlation length which peaks at $V_2/t \approx 1.5$ suggests a second order transition between the CDW I and Kekul\'e phase.
%
Moreover, we can see the presence of a remnant charge order on top of the bond modulation in the Kekul\'e phase close to the critical point.
%
This signals a slow onset of charge ordering as a finite size effect as we approach the phase boundary from the Kekul\'e side which would be in contradiction to a level crossing for which the charge order should change suddenly.
%
In the Kekul\'e phase, the correlation length scales with $\chi$ even in the center of the phase.
%
This can be attributed to the fact that it is not a strong coupling phase in which the gap is determined by the interaction but rather by the hopping energy scale.

The next phase boundary we cross is between the Kekul\'e and the semimetal phase at $V_2/t \approx 1.9$.
%
From the data presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:cut_V1_6} it is not possible reach a conclusion about the nature of the transition.
%
However, from the Landau theory perspective the semimetal--Kekul\'e transition has to be first order for the following reason.
%
The Kekul\'e bond order is in the $E_1'$ representation and the lowest order term in the Landau free energy is of third order $(E_{1x}')^3-3E_{1y}'(E_{1x}')^2$.
\noteJM{Fernando, can you rewrite the last two sentences and add an explanatory sentence maybe? Thanks for the commment!}
%
The assumption of a first order transition also agrees with the entanglement entropy which displays a small jump when crossing the phase boundary.
%

In the semimetal phase, we observe an astonishingly small correlation length for a critical state.
%
The reason for that, as we explained in Sec.~\ref{subsec:SM}, is that the hopping strengths around and along the cylinder are strongly renormalized leading to an effectively gapped state for a finite cylinder circumference.
%

Finally, at $V_2/t \approx 2.4$ the semimetal turns into the CDW II.
%
The clearly diverging correlation length on the CDW II side of the transition strongly points toward a second order phase transition.
%
Moreover, the strong dependence of $\xi$ on the bond dimension suggests that the ground state is becoming critical as we approach the critical point, especially compared to the behaviour of $\xi$ deep in the phase.

\section{\label{sec:discconc}Discussion and Conclusions}
%

The spontaneous emergence of the Chern insulator phase due to interactions in the half-filled spineless honeycomb lattice
model has been questioned by different methods since its proposal~\cite{RQHZ08,WF10,GCC13,GGNVC13,DH14,DCH14}.
%
In this work we have gone beyond previous mean field and exact diagonalization by using the iDMRG method, an algorithm that allows for quantum fluctuations
to play a role but minimises the finite size effects due its intrinsic infinite cylinder geometry.
%%
%All disputed phases are gapped and therefore ideal for iDMRG to asses since correlation lengths and
%entanglement decay rapidly in gapped phases.\\

One of our main results is the absence of the Haldane Chern insulator state in this model.
%
It seems therefore that quantum fluctuations indeed jeopardize its emergence and work against
the naive mean field expectations.
%
Although there is no reason to believe that the situation is different for the $\pi-$flux model, which also hosts a
mean field Chern insulating phase that is absent in exact diagonalization~\cite{WF10,JGC13}, 
there is more hope for other frustrated models.
%
In particular, the interacting Kagome lattice hosts a Chern insulator state when the filling is tuned to
the quadratic band point touching between the flat band and one of the two dispersive bands.
%
Its presence is predicted within the renormalization group approach~\cite{SF08,SYF09} which should guarantee
its robustness at sufficiently low interaction strength.\\
%
In addition we have theoretically predicted two novel competing phases, the CDW II and CDW III.
%
These states are topologically trivial charge ordered states that have a twelve site unit cell.
%
Such a large unit cell turns their identification within exact diagonalization or mean field studies 
challenging and highlights the advantages of the iDMRG method.
%
On the one hand the CDW II phase is a strong coupling phase that is stable upon perturbation theory in $V_{1,2}/t$.
%
Its presence is guaranteed as long as the system does not frustrate its order. 
%
The CDW III in turn is not connected to any strong coupling phase.

From the evidence presented in this work we have established that CMs phase state occurs from first
order perturbation theory in powers of $t/V_{2}$ of an otherwise classically degenerate ground state.
%
This part of our work establishes the existence and robustness 
of this single particle charge order, beyond numerical approximations.
%
Our semiclassical analysis, corroborated by the iDMRG numerical evidence presented here,
provides an explanation of why this phase has a many-body gap of the order of the hopping strength $t/V_{2}$ 
rather than determined by $V_{2}$ as was previously noticed~\cite{GCC13,DH14,DCH14}.
%
The CMs is thus stable for small $V_{1}$ and finite $t$, increasing the former or reducing the latter leads to the CDW II classical ground state
through a first order phase transition.\\
%
Finally, we have used that the iDMRG method treats an infinite system as opposed to a finite cluster to analyse 
the different phase transitions using in particular the entanglement entropy $S$ and $\xi$.
%
The conclusions drawn from analyzing these quantities have sometimes to be complemented by the continuous 
or discontinuous dependence of the ground state energy on the $\left\lbrace V_{1},V_{2}\right\rbrace$ interactions.
%

To conclude we have established the phase diagram of spinless electrons hoping on the half-filled honey comb lattice
with nearest and next to nearest hopping interactions and characterised the phase transitions among the different phases with iDMRG.
%
Our results provide solid evidence that Chern insulating phases are far more elusive than previously thought and
so alternative routes are necessary to drive these kind of topological states from strong electronic correlations in general.

\appendix

\section{\label{sec:appendix} Strong coupling perturbation theory}

In this Appendix we discuss the exact diagonalization method to determine the ground state in the strong coupling limit $t \ll V_{1,2}$. 
%
Consider splitting the Hamiltonian in Eq. \eqref{eq:H} into $H =H_V + H_t$ with
\begin{align}
%
 H_t &=-t\sum_{\left\langle i,j\right\rangle}(c^{\dagger}_{i}c^{\vphantom{\dagger}}_{j}+ \mathrm{h.c.}) \\
 %
H_V &= V_{1}\sum_{\left\langle i,j\right\rangle }n_{i}n_{j}+
%
V_{2}\sum_{\left\langle \left\langle i,j\right\rangle \right\rangle }n_{i}n_{j}. 
%
\label{eq:Hsplit}
\end{align}
%
In the strong coupling limit, we can obtain the ground state of $H$ by diagonalizing $H_V$ first and considering $H_t$ as a perturbation. 
%
The eigenstates of $H_V$
\begin{equation}
H_V \psi_{n,m} = E_n \psi_{n,m},
\end{equation}
where $m$ accounts for degeneracies, are simple to compute because charge is conserved at every site in the absence of hopping. 
%
$H_V$ is thus already diagonal in the occupation basis, i.e.
\begin{equation}
\left| \psi^{n,m}\right> = \prod_{C^{n,m}_i = 1} c^\dagger_i \left|0\right>,
\end{equation}
%
 with $C^{n,m}_i=0,1$ the occupation coefficients for the $n,m$ eigenstate. 
 %
The classical ground state manifold is spanned by $\left|\psi^{0,m}\right>$, with $m=1,\dots,M$.   

For small $t/V_{1,2}$, we can disregard the classical states with $n>0$, and project the $H_t$ Hamiltonian into the classical ground state manifold. 
%
Dropping the label $n=0$ from now on
%
\begin{equation}
(\tilde{H}_t)_{m_1m_2} =  \left< \psi^{m_1} \right| H_t \left| \psi^{m_2} \right>.
\end{equation}
%
We can now diagonalize $\tilde{H}_t$ and select the eigenstates of lowest energy $\epsilon_0$
%
\begin{equation}
\tilde{H}_t v_\alpha = \epsilon_0 v_\alpha,
\end{equation}
%
where $\alpha = 1,\ldots,D$ and $D$ is the true ground state degeneracy. The final ground state of $H$ is spanned by
%
\begin{equation}
\left| GS\right>_\alpha = \sum_{m=1}^M v^m_\alpha \left| \psi^m\right>.
\end{equation}
%
Obtaining the coefficients $v^m_\alpha$ is relatively simple because the effective size of the Hilbert space $M$ is much smaller than the full size of the Hilbert space of $H$.\\
%

We have used this method to diagonalize a cluster of $3\times3$ unit cells (18 sites), and a cluster with the shape of the unit cell of the CDW II phase (12 sites), see Fig.~\ref{}\noteAG{Fig needed}. The results for the spectra can be summarized as follows. \\
%
In the case of the $3\times3$ cluster, at $t=0$ we find four possible classical ground states as a function of increasing $V_1$, with degeneracies 234, 108, 36, 2.
%
The projection of $H_t$ into these classical ground states is finite only for the first two, and the pattern of degeneracies at low energies becomes $(4,10,4,\ldots)$ for both.
%
This low energy pattern is the same as the one that is obtained for the CMs phase in exact diagonalization \cite{GGNVC13}, 
pointing to the fact that these two states represent the CMs phase.
%
Further evidence to support this claim is also shown below. 
%
The energies of the four states in these clusters~\noteAG{which clusters? now we are talking about the $3\times 3$ only or both?} are given by
\noteAG{We might want to explain why we call these states CMs int and CDW. It is not clear why you label them like this (especially the last two).}
%
\begin{eqnarray}
E_{\mathrm{CMs}} &=& \frac{V_2}{2} + \frac{V_1}{3} -0.248t \hspace{8mm} \tfrac{V_1}{V_2} < \tfrac{3}{2}\\
E_{\mathrm{CMs}} &=& \frac{2V_2}{3} + \frac{2V_1}{9} -0.055t \hspace{5mm}   \tfrac{3}{2} <\tfrac{V_1}{V_2} < 3\\
E_{\mathrm{int}} &=& \frac{V_2}{2} + \frac{V_1}{4} \hspace{22mm}   3 <\tfrac{V_1}{V_2} < 4\\
\label{eqap:ECDW}
E_{\mathrm{CDW}} &=& \frac{3V_2}{2}   \hspace{29mm}   4 < \tfrac{V_1}{V_2}
\end{eqnarray}
%
and define the three types of \noteAG{What is the difference between the first two energies? They are different CMs states right? If so
we might want to say it, see previous comment} strong coupling phases of this cluster.\\
%
In the CDW II cluster of Fig. \ref{}\noteAG{Fig needed}, we find only two possible ground states with degeneracies 8 and 2.
% 
The projection of $H_t$ in these subspaces is zero for both cases, which means that both are stable strong coupling phases.
%
The first can be identified with the classical version of the CDW II state, where the two values of the occupancies are 0 or 1.
%
The 8 states correspond to the 8 equivalent ways to ensemble the CDW II pattern in the given unit cell. 
%
The energy per site for this state is given by
%
\begin{equation}
E_{\mathrm{CDWII}} = \frac{1}{2}V_2 + \frac{1}{4}V_1.
\end{equation}
%
As explained in the main text, this energy is lower than any classical energy of the $3\times3$ cluster. It is only the quantum corrections that make the CMs phase favored at low $V_1$. 
 %
The second is the CDW state, its energy per site given by Eq.~\eqref{eqap:ECDW}.

%
In the two clusters studied with perturbation theory, only the state we have labeled as the CMs state is non trivial in the sense that it has first order quantum corrections.
%
We now show that this state is in fact the CMs state. 
%
To do so, we recall that in finite size ED there is no spontaneous symmetry breaking, because all states related by symmetry are degenerate and will be present in the ground state manifold.
%
Therefore, to detect an ordered phase we resort to computing correlation functions evaluated in the ground state, from which order parameters can be obtained. 
%
 
Correlation functions for charge order parameters can be expressed in general as
\begin{equation}
\rho_{ij\ldots} = {\rm tr} \left< GS \right| c^\dagger_i c_ic^\dagger_j c_j \ldots \left| GS \right> 
\end{equation}
which is given explicitly by
\begin{equation}
\rho_{ij\ldots} = \sum_{m,\alpha} (v_m^\alpha)^*v_m^\alpha C^m_i C^m_j \dots
\end{equation}
Fourier transforming the real space indices $ij\ldots$ and taking the combinations defined in the main text for the representations $B_2$ and $G$, we can compute any correlation function of order parameters $\left< GS \right| O_1 O_2 \ldots \left| GS \right> $ with $O = G, B_2$. 
%
The simplest scalars that signal the presence of an order parameter are simply the two point functions
\begin{align}
S_1 &= B_2^2 \\
S_2 &= |G_1|^2+|G_2|^2 
\end{align}
and both are found to be finite~\noteAG{finite where? Not clear what are you referring to}. However, this is not enough information to distinguish the CMs phase. We have also computed the correlation functions of higher order
%\begin{figure}[t]
%\begin{center}
%\includegraphics[width=8cm]{chargeins.pdf}
%\caption{All possible charge instabilities in the 6-site cell, with their corresponding label in
%$C_{6v}''$ and in $C_{6v}$ (in parenthesis). Note the normalization of $B_2$ with respect to $G$ is
%arbitrary. We have chosen to normalize both to 1.}
%\label{chargeins}
%\end{center}
%\end{figure}

%For the CMs phase, this is not too complicated. In the 6 site unit cell, the 6 possible order parameters with their symmetry labels are shown in Fig.\ref{chargeins}. The usual CDW is $B_2$ and the four CMs belong to the $G$ irrep. We label the components of this representation as $G = (\vec G_1 , \vec G_2) = (G_{1x},G_{1y},G_{2x},G_{2y})$, because $\vec G_i$ are vectors under $C_3$ rotations. It is easier to write scalars using complex numbers $G_i = G_{i,x}+ i G_{i,y}$, and representing $C_3$ rotations as $e^{i2\pi/3}$. 

\begin{align}
S_3 &= {\rm Im}(G_2^3-3G_2 G_1^2)  \\
S_4 &= B_2 {\rm Im}(G_1G_2) \\
S_5 &= [{\rm Im}(G_1G_2)]^2 \\
S_6 &= B_2{\rm Re}(G_1^3-3G_1 G_2^2)
\end{align}
and found that only $S_6$ is finite, therefore confirming the presence of the CMs phase with the strong coupling approach.

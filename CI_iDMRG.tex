Emergence of the Chern insulator state.


\section{Model and Method}
%
Method\\
%
In this work we focus on spinless electrons in a honeycomb lattice with real  nearest neighbor hopping $t$ and nearest and next to nearest neighbor interactions 
$\left\lbrace V_{1},V_{2}\right\rbrace$. 
%
The Hamiltonian for this system can be written as
 %
\begin{eqnarray}
\nonumber
%
H&:=&-t\sum_{\left\langle i,j\right\rangle ,s,s'}(c^{\dagger}_{i,s}c_{j,s'}+h.c.)\\
%
\;&+&
V_{1}\sum_{\left\langle i,j\right\rangle ,s }n_{i,s}n_{j,\bar{s}}+
%
V_{2}\sum_{\left\langle \left\langle i,j\right\rangle \right\rangle ,s }n_{i,s}n_{j,s}\,
%
\label{eq:H}
%
\end{eqnarray}
%
here $c_{i,s}$ $(c^{\dagger}_{i,s})$  annihilates (creates) an electron at the $i$-th unit cell of the honeycomb lattice
in sublattice $s=A,B$ and $s\neq\bar{s}$. 
%
Each of the two triangular sublattices A and B is spanned by the basis vectors
$\bs{a}_{1}=\bs{\delta}_{2}-\bs{\delta}_{3}$ and 
$\bs{a}_{2}=\bs{\delta}_{3}-\bs{\delta}_{1}$ defined through the three nearest neighbors $\bs{\delta}_{1}=a(0,-1)$,  
$\bs{\delta}_{2}=a(\sqrt{3}/2,1/2)$ and $\bs{\delta}_{3}=a(-\sqrt{3}/2,+1/2)$ as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Defs}.

\section{Phase diagram}
%
We have used the iDMRG method presented in the previous section
to find the groundstate of the half-filled graphene lattice in the presence of 
$\left\lbrace V_{1},V_{2}\right\rbrace$ interactions
%
Our results are summarised in the phase diagram presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase diagram}.
%
As a function of $\left\lbrace V_{1},V_{2}\right\rbrace$ we find six different ordered phases and none of them correspond to the Haldane Chern insulator.
%
In what follows we describe their corresponding charge and bond ordering patterns and analyse the different phase transitions that occur between them.
%

%
\subsection{Semimetal phase}
%
We start by discussing the phase diagram at small $\left\lbrace V_{1},V_{2}\right\rbrace$.
%
In this region we find that the groundstate is a semimetal phase, labelled SM in the phase diagram shown in Fig.~\ref{}.
%
It is connected to the gapless non-interacting state $V_{1}=V_{2}=0$ and it generically presents a uniform renormalization of the hopping strength 
$t$ by interactions.
%
As such, it is a single particle gapless phase that lacks both charge and bond order.

Within the iDMRG algorithm we have characterised the semimetal phase in three distinct ways.
%
Firstly we compute the charge and bond ground state expectation values.
%
On the one hand, at each site the charge expectation value is defined by 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:charge}
n_{i,s}=\left\langle c^{\dagger}_{i,s}c_{i,s}\right\rangle,  
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $s=A,B$ is the sublattice index.
%
To numerical accuracy we find that $n_{i,A}=n_{i,B}=1/2$, indicating that this phase is not charge ordered.
%

The bond ground state expectation value on the other hand is defined as
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:charge}
t^{s,s'}_{i,j}=\left\langle c^{\dagger}_{i,s}c_{j,s'}\right\rangle,  
\end{eqnarray}
%
For $i,j$ being nearest neighbours we find a small ($10^{-?}$) asymmetry
between bonds pointing along and around the cylinder axis which should vanish for a perfect semimetalic phase.
%
In fact, the asymmetry is reduced as the bond dimension $\chi$ is increased.
% 
This suggests that the observed asymmetry can be attributed to the cylinder geometry that is implemented in iDMRG.
%
Moreover, the semimetal phase is a critical state and thus in principle requires an infinite $\chi$ to represent the state.

%
This leads to the second way that we use to characterise this phase that makes use of the mentioned criticality.
%
For a critical phase such as the semimetal the entanglement entropy is expected to show a logarithmic growth
with the correlation length.
%
The proportionality constant $c/3$ defines the central charge of the theory $c$. 
%
The semimetal has two Dirac cones and therefore it is expected that $c=2$. 
%

%
Lastly 



%
In the renormalisation group sense short range interactions are irrelevant~\cite{Shankar?} and 
therefore, interactions can only drive order when they are comparable to the nearest neighbour hopping strength $t$.
%
Accordingly we find that the semimetal is stable within this region of phase space.
%



\subsection{Charge density wave}
%
Classically, for large $V_{1}\gg t$ the energy is minimised by charge imbalance between the two sub lattices.
%
The resulting phase, the staggered charge density wave state, has a two site unit cell that is characterised by the order parameter
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:CDW}
%
M=\left\langle n_{A} \right\rangle-\left\langle n_{B}\right\rangle
%
\end{equation}
%
where $n_{A}$ and $n_{B}$ are the density of electrons in the $A$ and $B$ sublattice sites of the two site unit cell respectively.
